/**
 * This is a POSIX-style regex implementation.  I'm not sure why a standard
 * implementation isn't used as this is a custom build under the hood, though
 * this supports most of the POSIX regex features.  The MUF man page for
 * smatch describes what this supports:
 *
 * *  A '?' matches any single character.
 *
 * *  A '*' matches any number of any characters.
 *
 * *  '{word1|word2|etc}' will match a single word, if it is one of those
 *       given, separated by | characters, between the {}s.  A word ends with
 *       a space or at the end of the string.  The given example would match
 *       either the words "word1", "word2", or "etc".
 *       {} word patterns will only match complete words: "{foo}*" and "{foo}p"
 *       do not match "foop" and "*{foo}" and "p{foo}" do not match "pfoo".
 *       {} word patterns can be easily meaningless; they will match nothing
 *       if they:
 *         (a) contains spaces,
 *         (b) do not follow a wildcard, space or beginning of string,
 *         (c) are not followed by a wildcard, space or end of string.
 *
 * *  If the first char of a {} word set is a '^', then it will match a single
 *       word if it is NOT one of those contained within the {}s.  Example:
 * *  '[aeiou]' will match a single character as long as it is one of those
 *       contained between the []s.  In this case, it matches any vowel.
 *
 * *  If the first char of a [] char set is a '^', then it will match a single
 *       character if it is NOT one of those contained within the []s.  Example:
 *       '[^aeiou]' will match any single character EXCEPT for a vowel.
 *
 * *  If a [] char set contains two characters separated by a '-', then it will
 *       match any single character that is between those two given characters.
 *       Example:  '[a-z0-9_]' would match any single character between 'a' and
 *       'z', inclusive, any character between '0' and '9', inclusive, or a '_'.
 *
 * *  The '\' character will disable the special meaning of the character that
 *       follows it, matching it literally.
 *
 * Example patterns:
 *   "d*g" matches "dg", "dog", "doog", "dorfg", etc.
 *   "d?g" matches "dog", "dig" and "dug" but not "dg" or "drug".
 *   "M[rs]." matches "Mr." and "Ms."
 *   "M[a-z]" matches "Ma", "Mb", etc.
 *   "[^a-z]" matches anything but an alphabetical character.
 *   "{Moira|Chupchup}*" matches "Moira snores" and "Chupchup arghs."
 *   "{Moira|Chupchup}*" does NOT match "Moira' snores".
 *   "{Foxen|Lynx|Fier[ao]} *t[iy]ckle*\?"  Will match any string starting
 *     with 'Foxen', 'Lynx', 'Fiera', or 'Fiero', that contains either 'tickle'
 *     or 'tyckle' and ends with a '?'.

 *
 * This is based on props; the gender prop is configured with @tune
 * and defaults to 'sex'.  The contents of that prop are parsed for MPI.
 * it will, under the hood, default to '_default' if nothing is set.
 *
 * By default it understands the strings "male", "female", "hermaphrodite",
 * "herm", and "neuter".  The understanding can be altered with props
 * in a variety of kinda complicated ways.
 *
 * First it checks for the pronoun set on the player itself, named
 * after the pronoun, such as %o:override if it is a supported pronoun
 * as lisfted above.
 *
 * If the pronoun is not one of the defaults supported by the system,
 * then it is searched for in the environment starting with the player
 * using envpropstr - so a prop named like %w:whatever
 *
 * Finally, it searches both the player and room #0 for props of
 * the format: _pronouns/{sex}/{prn}   <-- _pronouns is controlled by
 * PRONOUNS_PROPDIR.  A sample of how this might work is like:
 *
 * _pronouns/male/%o:whatever
 *
 * Finally, if the gender is unknown, and no other props are set, it
 * checks _pronouns/_default/{prn}
 *
 * If all else fails, it uses the default baked in pronouns, which
 * are either the player's name (if the gender is unknown) or
 * based on the arrays absolute, subjective, posessive, objective,
