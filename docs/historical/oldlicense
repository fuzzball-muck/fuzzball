Once upon a time, TinyMUD was released and Copyright (c) 1989 by David Applegate, James Aspnes, and Bennet Yee under an unusual and unique licence nearly identical to fb5.68/include/copyright.h
This license was kept, with minor modifications, even to the final releases of fb5.  Additional licensing stipulations were added by Dr. Cat and ChupChup, found in fb5.68/src/copyright.c and fb5.68/docs/COPYING respectively.
Sometime during fb6, Revar (foxen, Garth Minette, Fuzzball Software) changed the license to all his code to the GPLv2 (with OpenSSL exception).  He kept the other licensing available because he knew he didn't hold copyright over all of Fuzzball's code.  However, the GPL is likely incompatible with TinyMUD's/fb5's unique license.  This is because the TinyMUD license has an advertising clause (much like the GPL-incompatible 4-clause BSD license) and also asks users to notify the original authors of their changes and uses of TinyMUD.  If the GPL and the TinyMUD license are incompatible, Revar's license change was illegal.
Sometime in fb7's alpha or beta stages, the non-GPL licensing information was removed (illegally, if any code still under that license remained) and the GPL bumped up to GPLv3 with OpenSSL exception.
I (maine coon) have written this document to bring the old license information back, and to describe the history of Fuzzball's licensing.  My personal hope is for the GPL-licensed code to be re-licensed under an open-source license compatible with the old licenses.
