<h3 id="startingout">The word 'me' refers to yourself. Some things to do when starting out:
<br>
1) give yourself a description with &quot;@describe me=&lt;description&gt;&quot;, then
<br>
</h3>
    look at yourself with &quot;look me&quot;.
2) prevent anyone else from robbing you with &quot;@lock me=me&quot;.
3) set your gender, if you wish it known, with &quot;@set me=sex:male&quot; or
<p>
    &quot;@set me=sex:female&quot; (or &quot;@set me=sex:neuter&quot; to be an 'it').

</p>
<!-- HTML_TOPICEND -->


<h3 id="say">SAY &lt;message&gt;
<br>
&quot;&lt;message&gt;
<br>

<br>
</h3>
  Says &lt;message&gt; out loud to everyone in the room.  If your name is Igor,
and you typed 'say Hello everyone!', you will see 'You say, &quot;Hello everyone!&quot;'
and everyone else in the room will see 'Igor says, &quot;Hello everyone!&quot;'
There's also an abbreviated form of the 'say' command: '&quot;Hello everyone!'
<p>Also see:
    <a href="#pose">POSE</a>,
    <a href="#whisper">WHISPER</a> and
    <a href="#page">PAGE</a>
</p>
<!-- HTML_TOPICEND -->


<h3 id="pose">POSE &lt;message&gt;
<br>
:&lt;message&gt;
<br>

<br>
</h3>
  Poses a message to everyone in the room.  This is used for actions.  i.e.:
if your name was Igor, and you typed 'pose falls down.', everyone would see
<pre>
    Igor falls down.
</pre>
There's also an abbreviated form of the 'pose' command: ':falls down.'
<p>Also see:
    <a href="#say">SAY</a>,
    <a href="#whisper">WHISPER</a> and
    <a href="#page">PAGE</a>
</p>
<!-- HTML_TOPICEND -->


<h3 id="page">PAGE &lt;player&gt;
<br>
PAGE &lt;player&gt;=&lt;message&gt;
<br>

<br>
</h3>
  In the first form, this tells a player your location, like
'You sense that &lt;pager&gt; is paging you from &lt;location&gt;.'

<p>
  In the second form, with the &lt;message&gt;, the user receives a message like:
'&lt;pager&gt; pages from &lt;location&gt;: &quot;&lt;message&gt;&quot;'

<p>
  If a player is set HAVEN, you cannot page them.  You will instead be told,
'That player does not wish to be disturbed.'

<p>
  Note: Most systems use a MUF program with a global 'page' action, which
takes the place of the built-in 'page' command, and has more features.
Usually, you can see the extra features of this MUF page program by using
the command 'page #help'.
<p>Also see:
    <a href="#say">SAY</a>,
    <a href="#pose">POSE</a> and
    <a href="#whisper">WHISPER</a>
</p>
<!-- HTML_TOPICEND -->


<h3 id="whisper">WHISPER &lt;player&gt;=&lt;message&gt;
<br>

<br>
</h3>
  Whispers the message to the named person, if they are in the same room
as you.  No one else can see the message.  Wizards can use the form
'whisper *&lt;player&gt;=&lt;message&gt;' to whisper to players in other rooms.
<p>
  Note: Most systems use a MUF program with a global 'whisper' action, which
takes the place of the built-in 'whisper' command, and has more features.
<p>Also see:
    <a href="#say">SAY</a>,
    <a href="#pose">POSE</a> and
    <a href="#page">PAGE</a>
</p>
<!-- HTML_TOPICEND -->


<h3 id="look">LOOK &lt;object&gt;
<br>

<br>
</h3>
  Looks around at the current room, or at &lt;object&gt; if specified.
For players, displays their description and inventory, for things,
their description, and for rooms, their name, description, succ/fail
message, and contents.  Also triggers osucc/ofail messages on rooms.
Programs are triggered accordingly on desc/succ/fail fields.
<!-- HTML_TOPICEND -->


<h3 id="inventory">INVENTORY
<br>

<br>
</h3>
  Lists what you are carrying. This can usually be abbreviated to inv or i.
<!-- HTML_TOPICEND -->


<h3 id="get">GET &lt;object&gt;
<br>
GET &lt;container&gt;=&lt;object&gt;
<br>

<br>
</h3>
  Attempts to pick up &lt;object&gt; in the first form.  The lock on &lt;object&gt; is
checked for a success (true), and the normal path of success/fail is then
taken.  On success the object is placed in your inventory.
<p>
  
<p>
  In the second form, attempts to get &lt;object&gt; from the given &lt;container&gt;.
The _/clk lock property on &lt;container&gt; is tested, and if it is true, then
it checks to see if the standard _/lok lock property on &lt;object&gt; tests true.
If both locks pass, then &lt;object&gt; is moved into the player's inventory.
If there is no _/clk property on &lt;container&gt; it defaults to failing.
The _/lok property, on &lt;object&gt;, on the other hand, defaults to passing.
@succ/@fail messages are not displayed, when fetching something from a
container.

<p>
  TAKE can also be used instead of GET.
<p>Also see:
    <a href="#success">SUCCESS</a>,
    <a href="#failure">FAILURE</a>,
    <a href="#@lock">@LOCK</a>,
    <a href="#put">PUT</a>,
    <a href="#drop">DROP</a> and
    <a href="#hand">HAND</a>
</p>
<!-- HTML_TOPICEND -->


<h3 id="put">PUT &lt;thing&gt;=&lt;container&gt;
<br>

<br>
</h3>
  Attempts to put &lt;thing&gt; into the given &lt;container&gt;.  The _/clk lock
property on &lt;container&gt; is tested, and if it is true, then it checks
to see if the standard _/lok lock property on &lt;thing&gt; tests true.
If both locks pass, then &lt;thing&gt; is moved from the player's inventory
into the given container.  If there is no _/clk property on &lt;container&gt;
it defaults to failing.  The _/lok property, on &lt;thing&gt;, on the other
hand, defaults to passing.  @succ/@fail messages are not displayed,
when putting something into a container.

<p>
  You can also put programs in containers, much the same as you can with
things.  Throw, put, and hand can be used instead of drop.
<p>Also see:

    <a href="#drop">DROP</a>
</p>
<!-- HTML_TOPICEND -->


<h3 id="drop">DROP &lt;thing&gt;
<br>

<br>
</h3>
  Drops the &lt;thing&gt; if you are holding it.  It moves the thing to the room
you are in, unless the thing's STICKY flag is set, or the room has a
drop-to.

<p>
  If the thing's STICKY flag is set, it will go home when dropped.

<p>
  If the room's drop-to is set, and the room has its STICKY flag set,
then the thing will stick around in the room until all players have left.
If the room is not set sticky, then the thing will be sent to the location
given by the room's drop-to.

<p>
  You can also drop programs, much like things, but they are not affected
by room droptos or STICKY flags.

<p>
  An '@drop' message can be set which will be shown to the player dropping
the object, and an '@odrop' message can be set, which will be shown to the
other players in the room.  Throw, put, and hand can be used instead of drop.

<h3 id="go">GO &lt;direction&gt;
<br>
GO home
<br>
MOVE &lt;direction&gt;
<br>
MOVE home
<br>

<br>
</h3>
  Move the player in a specific direction.  'go home' is a special
command that returns to you to your starting location.  'go' may be
omitted by simply specifying a direction, and 'goto', 'move' are the
same as 'go'.

<p>
  Examples:
<pre>
    go home            teleport home, *leaving behind all possessions*
                       (See 'help home')
    goto kitchen       go to the exit called 'kitchen'
    move up            move in the direction 'up', if it exists
    north              move to the exit 'north', if it exists
</pre>
<p>Also see:
    <a href="#home">HOME</a>
</p>
<!-- HTML_TOPICEND -->


<h3 id="home">HOME
<br>

<br>
</h3>
  Sends you home, no matter where you are. You retain your pennies, but
any objects you are carrying leave your inventory and return to their own
homes. See HOMES.
<p>Also see:
    <a href="#go">GO</a> and
    <a href="#homes">HOMES</a>
</p>
<!-- HTML_TOPICEND -->


<h3 id="goal">Goal:
<br>

<br>
</h3>
  There is no ultimate goal to this game, except to have fun.  There are
puzzles to solve, scenery to visit, and people to meet. There are no
winners or losers, only fellow players. Enjoy.
<!-- HTML_TOPICEND -->


<h3 id="score">SCORE
<br>

<br>
</h3>
  Displays how many pennies you are carrying.  Pretty meaningless.
<!-- HTML_TOPICEND -->


<h3 id="money">Building and some other actions cost money.  How to get money:
<br>
</h3>
    1) Get pennies from the local bank.
<p>
    2) Find pennies.
<p>
    3) Get killed.
<p>
    4) Be given money by another player.
<p>
    5) Rob someone.
Once you reach 10000 pennies, it becomes difficult to acquire
more.  Wizards don't need money to do anything.
<p>Also see:
    <a href="#costs">COSTS</a>
</p>
<!-- HTML_TOPICEND -->


<h3 id="give">GIVE &lt;player|object&gt;=&lt;amount&gt;
<br>

<br>
</h3>
  Gives &lt;amount&gt; pennies from your supply to &lt;player&gt;.  Mortals may only
give positive amounts and may not cause a player to have more than 10000
pennies.  Wizards do not affect their penny supplies by giving to others,
and may also give pennies to objects, changing that object's value.
<!-- HTML_TOPICEND -->


<h3 id="examine">EXAMINE &lt;object&gt;[=proppattern]
<br>
</h3>
  
<p>
  If you do not control &lt;object&gt;, it prints the owner of the object.
<p>
  
<p>
  If you control &lt;object&gt;, examine will give you a complete breakdown of
all standard fields, flags, etc that are associated with the object.
MPI in the the displayed fields will be shown raw, without executing it.
<p>
  
<p>
  If the optional proppattern field is supplied, then it instead lists
out all the properties that matches the given wildcard pattern.  If the
pattern ends with '/' then all the sub-properties in the matching propdirs
will be listed.  If the pattern ends with **, then all sub-propdirs of
the matching properties will be shown recursively.
<p>
  
<pre>
  ex obj=/        list all root properties on obj.
  ex obj=/**      list ALL properties on obj.

<h3 id="types">Object Types:
<br>

<br>
</h3>
  There are 5 types of objects:
Players are the objects users log in as; their avatars.
Things are objects that can be carried, or that can sit about a room.
Rooms are locations that contain players and things and linked exits.
Exits are the means by which players move between rooms.
Programs are player-written extensions to the game.

<p>
  The first letter following an object's ID number indicates the type:
P(layer), E(xit), F(orth program), or R(oom).  Otherwise it's a Thing.
<!-- HTML_TOPICEND -->


<h3 id="objectmatching">Referring to Objects:
<br>

<br>
</h3>
  You can specify objects (things, players, exits, and rooms) by name if
they're in your inventory or in the same room as you. You need only type
enough letters of the name to be unambiguous. You can also specify objects
anywhere by their DBRef, in the form #&lt;dbrefnumber&gt;. Players in other rooms
may be specified in the form *&lt;player name&gt;. The keywords 'me' can be used
for yourself, and 'here' for the room you're in.

<p>
  Each object has an ID number (the 'dbref'), which appears after the
name of the object, and is followed by any flags on the object; Ie:
Foo(#3672PB) is a Player, named Foo, set BUILDER.  The number is a
database reference, and is used to specify objects at a distance;
Ie. 'examine #3672'. You will only see the ID number of objects you
own, or which are set LINK_OK, ABODE, or CHOWN_OK. Wizards can see the
numbers and flags on all objects.
<p>Also see:
    <a href="#flags">FLAGS</a>,
    <a href="#types">TYPES</a>,
    <a href="#abode">ABODE</a>,
    <a href="#chown_ok">CHOWN_OK</a> and
    <a href="#link_ok">LINK_OK</a>
</p>
<!-- HTML_TOPICEND -->


<h3 id="control">Control:
<br>

<br>
There are 3 rules to controlling objects:
<br>
<pre>
</h3>
  1) You control anything you own.
  2) A wizard or God controls everything.
  3) If Realms_Control is @tuned on in the server, then if a player owns an
     environmental room, and that room has its Wizard bit set, then the owner
     of that environment room has control over anything contained in that env-
     ironment room.  This includes things inside of rooms that are inside of
     that environment room, and so forth.  Everything in that Wizbit environ-
     ment can be controlled by the environment's owner. 
</pre>
<p>
  
There are a few things to keep in mind, in relation to the above:
<pre>
  a) Anybody can @chown an unlinked exit to themselves, even if it is locked.
     Builders should beware of this, lest their exits be linked or stolen.
     Once the object has been chowned, then it will be controlled by the
     owner, as per rule 1.
  b) Players can @chown to themselves any exits which are linked to an object
     they own.  Note Rule #1.
  c) Players can @chown to themselves any exits which are attached to an object
     that they own.  Note Rule #1.
  d) If an object is set CHOWN_OK, anyone may &quot;@chown &lt;object&gt;=me&quot; and gain
     ownership and control of the object. (see chown_ok)
</pre>
<!-- HTML_TOPICEND -->


<h3 id="@create">@CREATE &lt;object&gt; [=&lt;cost&gt;[=&lt;regname&gt;]]
<br>

<br>
</h3>
  Creates a new object and places it in your inventory.  This costs at
least ten pennies.  If &lt;cost&gt; is specified, you are charged that many
pennies, and in return, the object is endowed with a value according
to the formula: ((cost / 5) - 1).  Usually the maximum value of an
object is 100 pennies, which would cost 505 pennies to create. If a
&lt;regname&gt; is specified, then the _reg/&lt;regname&gt; property on the player
is set to the dbref of the new object.  This lets players refer to
the object as $&lt;regname&gt; (ie: $mybutton) in @locks, @sets, et cetera.
Only a builder may use this command.
<p>Also see:
    <a href="#@clone">@CLONE</a>
</p>
<!-- HTML_TOPICEND -->


<h3 id="@clone">@CLONE &lt;object&gt; [=&lt;regname&gt;]
<br>

<br>
</h3>
  Clones the given object, including name, location, flags, and
properties.  You must have control of the object, you may not clone
rooms, exits, etc, and cloning may cost pennies.  If successful, the
command prints the identifier of the new object.  Only a Builder may
use this command.

<p>
  Example:
<pre>
    @clone some_object
</pre>
<p>Also see:
    <a href="#@create">@CREATE</a>
</p>
<!-- HTML_TOPICEND -->


<h3 id="@dig">@DIG &lt;room&gt; [=&lt;parent&gt; [=&lt;regname&gt;]]
<br>

<br>
</h3>
  Creates a new room, sets its parent, and gives it a personal registered
name.  If no parent is given, it defaults to the first ABODE room down the
environment tree from the current room.  If it fails to find one, it sets
the parent to the global environment, which is typically room #0.  If no
&lt;regname&gt; is given, then it doesn't register the object.  If one is given,
then the object's dbref is recorded in the player's _reg/&lt;regname&gt; property,
so that they can refer to the object later as $&lt;regname&gt;.  Digging a room
costs 10 pennies, and you must be able to link to the parent room if
specified.  Only a builder may use this command.
<!-- HTML_TOPICEND -->


<h3 id="@open">@OPEN &lt;exit&gt; [=&lt;object&gt; [; &lt;object2&gt;; ... &lt;objectn&gt; ] [=&lt;regname&gt;]]
<br>

<br>
</h3>
  Opens an exit in the current room, optionally attempting to link it
simultaneously.  If a &lt;regname&gt; is specified, then the _reg/&lt;regname&gt;
property on the player is set to the dbref of the new object.  This lets
players refer to the object as $&lt;regname&gt; (ie: $mybutton) in @locks,
@sets, etc.  Opening an exit costs a penny, and an extra penny to link
it, and you must control the room where it is being opened.
<!-- HTML_TOPICEND -->


<h3 id="@action">@ACTION &lt;name&gt;=&lt;source&gt; [=&lt;regname&gt;]
<br>

<br>
</h3>
  Creates a new action and attaches it to the thing, room, or player
specified.  If a &lt;regname&gt; is specified, then the _reg/&lt;regname&gt; property
on the player is set to the dbref of the new object.  This lets players
refer to the object as $&lt;regname&gt; (ie: $mybutton) in @locks, @sets, etc.
You may only attach actions you control to things you control.  Creating
an action costs 1 penny.  The action can then be linked with the command
@LINK.
<!-- HTML_TOPICEND -->


<h3 id="bogus">Bogus Exits and Pseudo Commands:
<br>

<br>
</h3>
  Bogus commands can be made using exits.  For example, to make a 'sit'
command, one could give the following commands:
<pre>
    @open sit
	@link sit=here                   (because unlinked exits can be stolen)
	@lock sit=me&amp;!me                 (therefore always fails)
	@fail sit=You sit on the chair.
    @ofail sit=sits on the chair.
</pre>
Since nobody can go through it, it always fails. The @fail message is
displayed to the player, and the @ofail message (preceded by the player's
name) to everyone else.
<!-- HTML_TOPICEND -->


<h3 id="@recycle">@RECYCLE &lt;object&gt;
<br>

<br>
</h3>
  Destroy an object and remove all references to it within the database.
The object is then added to a free list, and newly created objects are
assigned from the pool of recycled objects first.  You *must* own the
object being recycled, even wizards must use the @chown command to
recycle someone else's belongings.
<!-- HTML_TOPICEND -->


<h3 id="@name">@NAME  &lt;object&gt;=&lt;name&gt; [&lt;password&gt;]
<br>

<br>
</h3>
  Sets the name field of &lt;object&gt; to &lt;name&gt;.  A null &lt;name&gt; is illegal.
You must supply &lt;password&gt; if renaming a player.  Wizards can rename
any player but still must include the password.
<!-- HTML_TOPICEND -->


<h3 id="@describe">@DESCRIBE [&lt;object&gt;][=[&lt;text&gt;]]
<br>

<br>
</h3>
  Shows &lt;object&gt;'s description, or sets it to &lt;text&gt;.  If &lt;object&gt; is not
specified, it defaults to 'me'. If &lt;text&gt; is not specified, the field is
cleared.  This uses the property '_/de'.

A description is shown to a player looking at &lt;object&gt;.

A drop message works differently depending on &lt;object&gt;'s type:

<p>
 On a room, it is shown to a player who drops an object there.
<p>
 On a thing, it is shown to a player who drops it.
<p>

<!-- HTML_TOPICEND -->


<h3 id="substitutions">Pronoun Substitutions:
<br>

<br>
</h3>
  @osuccess, @ofail, and @odrop messages may contain %-substitutions,
which evaluate to gender-specific pronouns if the player's 'sex' property
is set. These substitutions are:
<pre>
    %a (absolute)       = Name's, his, hers, its.
    %s (subjective)     = Name, he, she, it.
    %o (objective)      = Name, him, her, it.
    %p (possessive)     = Name's, his, her, its.
    %r (reflexive)      = Name, himself, herself, itself.
    %n (player's name)  = Name.
</pre>
Capitalized pronouns are also available with %A, %S, %O, %P, and %R.
If you need a '%', use %%.
<p>
  
<p>
  The naturally supported genders are 'male', 'female', 'neuter', 'herm',
and 'hermaphrodite', with the last two being equivalent, both using the
sie/hir/hirself/hirs pronoun set.
<p>
 
This set of supported genders can be extended either on an individual
player, or globally by adding _pronouns/GENDER/%X properties on the
player, or on #0 respectively.  For example, to add support on yourself
for a 'stallion' gender, you would add five properties, one for each
of the %a, %s, %o, %p, and %r pronouns, in the _pronouns/stallion/
propdir.  Ie:
<pre>
    @set me=_pronouns/stallion/%a:his
    @set me=_pronouns/stallion/%s:he
    @set me=_pronouns/stallion/%o:him
    @set me=_pronouns/stallion/%p:his
    @set me=_pronouns/stallion/%r:himself
</pre>

If a shapeshifting player decided that they prefer a different subjective
pronoun for themselve while they were in herm form, they could override it
with something like:
<p>
    @set me=_pronouns/herm/%s:shi
This would only override the %s pronoun while their gender was 'herm',
though, meaning that if they shapeshift to male, they only have to change
their 'sex' property, and not tweak their pronouns as well.
<p>
  
If a player sets a %a, %s, %o, %p, or %r property on themselve, that value
WILL be used, instead of any matching _pronouns/GENDER/%X property.  This
lets players make quick temporary pronoun fixes, and is also available
for legacy reasons.
<p>
  
Ex. '@ofail teapot=burns %p hand on the hot teapot.'

<br>
</h3>
  You can link to a room if you control it, or if it is set LINK_OK or ABODE.
Being able to link means you can set the homes of objects or yourself to that
room if it is set ABODE, and can set the destination of exits to that room if 
it is LINK_OK. See LINK_OK, ABODE, and @LINK.

<h3 id="@link">@LINK &lt;object1&gt;=&lt;object2&gt; [; &lt;object3&gt;; ...  &lt;objectn&gt; ]
<br>

<br>
</h3>
  Links &lt;object1&gt; to &lt;object2&gt;, provided you control &lt;object1&gt;, and
&lt;object2&gt; is either controlled by you or linkable.  Actions may be
linked to more than one thing, specified in a list separated by

<h3 id="@unlink">@UNLINK &lt;exit&gt;
<br>
@UNLINK here
<br>

<br>
</h3>
  Removes the link on the exit in the specified direction, or removes the
drop-to on the room. Unlinked exits may be picked up and dropped elsewhere.
Be careful, anyone can relink an unlinked exit, becoming its new owner
(but you will be reimbursed your 1 penny).

<h3 id="homes">Homes:
<br>

<br>
</h3>
  Every thing or player has a home. This is where things go when they
are sent home, or things with the STICKY flag set go when dropped.
Homes are set with the @link command.  A thing's home defaults to the
room where it was created, if you control that room, or your home.
You can link an exit to send players home (with their inventory) with
<pre>
    @link &lt;exit&gt;=home
</pre>
Drop-tos can also be set to 'home'. @teleport accepts home as an argument,
so you can @teleport things (and players if you are a wizard) to their home.
<p>Also see:
    <a href="#@teleport">@TELEPORT</a>,

</p>
<!-- HTML_TOPICEND -->


<h3 id="drop-to">Drop-to:
<br>

<br>
</h3>
  When the @link command is used on a room, it sets a drop-to location.  Any
object dropped in the room (if it isn't STICKY) will go to that location. If
the room is STICKY, the drop-to will be delayed until the last person in the
room has left.
<!-- HTML_TOPICEND -->


<h3 id="@lock">@LOCK [&lt;object&gt;][=[&lt;key&gt;]]
<br>

<br>
</h3>
  Shows &lt;object&gt;'s lock, or sets it to &lt;key&gt;.  If &lt;object&gt; is not specified,
it defaults to 'me'. If &lt;key&gt; is not specified, the field is cleared.  This
uses the property '_/lk'.

A lock that is not passed prevents players from using &lt;object&gt;.

<p>
  Examples:
<pre>
    @lock thingy=*Igor
    @lock thingy=me|#1234
    @lock here=me|Other Thingy
    @lock west=sex:female
    @lock east=((*Igor|*JohnDoe)&amp;sex:male)

<!-- HTML_TOPICEND -->


<h3 id="success">Success:
<br>

<br>

<br>
@SET &lt;object&gt; = &lt;property&gt;:
<br>
@SET &lt;object&gt; = :clear
<br>
</h3>
  
<p>
  @set does one of three things on TinyMUCK, it can modify flags, add
properties to an object, or remove properties from an object.
<p>
  
<p>
  Using the first format, you may set flags, which are:
	ABODE (AUTOSTART)
	BUILDER (BOUND)
	CHOWN_OK (COLOR)
	DARK (DEBUG)
	HAVEN (HARDUID)
	JUMP_OK
	KILL_OK
	LINK_OK
	MUCKER
	QUELL
	STICKY (SETUID)
	VEHICLE (VIEWABLE)
	WIZARD
	XFORCIBLE
	ZOMBIE
<p>
  You can also set the MUCKER (or Priority) Level of an object by using
0, 1, 2, or 3 as the flag name.
<p>
  
<p>
  The second format sets &lt;property&gt; on &lt;object&gt; to &lt;string&gt;

<p>
  The third format will remove &lt;property&gt; and any sub-properties under it.
<p>
  
<p>
  The fourth format removes all properties from an object.
<p>Also see:
    <a href="#flaghelp">FLAGHELP</a>

<!-- HTML_TOPICEND -->


<h3 id="@propset">@PROPSET &lt;object&gt;=&lt;type&gt;:&lt;property&gt;:&lt;value&gt; -or-
<br>
@PROPSET &lt;object&gt;=erase:&lt;property&gt;
<br>
</h3>
  
<p>
  @propset can set and clear properties from an object.
<p>
  
<p>
  If the first format above is specified, the @propset command sets
&lt;property&gt; on &lt;object&gt; to &lt;value&gt;, where &lt;value&gt; is of type &lt;type&gt;.
&lt;type&gt; can be one of 'string', 'integer', 'float, 'dbref', or 'lock'.
A string can be any set of characters the MUCK recognizes.  An integer
must be composed solely of numerals with the possible exception of
a leading sign indicator (+ or -).  A float must be a valid floating
point number.  A dbref must be of the form # followed by a positive
integer, and it must be a valid dbref (i.e., the object must exist).
A lock value must be a key that would be accepted by @lock or a similar
command (see the help for @lock for more details).
<p>
  
<p>
  The second format removes &lt;property&gt; on object.  Note that if &lt;property&gt;
is a propdir, it removes all properties below &lt;property&gt; as well.
If you wish to clear the value of a propdir without removing the
properties below it, use '@propset &lt;object&gt; = integer:&lt;property&gt;:0'.
<!-- HTML_TOPICEND -->


<h3 id="@register">
<br>
</h3>
  Lists registered objects, or manages existing object registrations, on
the target object and propdir.

The default target is &quot;_reg&quot; on #0, but can be changed with these prefixes:

<pre>
  #me
	Sets target object to you.
  #prop [&lt;target&gt;]:&lt;propdir&gt;
	Sets target object to &lt;target&gt;, and target propdir to &lt;propdir&gt;.
	&lt;target&gt; may be omitted to keep the default.
</pre>

Syntax:
<pre>
  @register [&lt;prefix&gt;]
    Lists registrations in the target propdir on the target object.
  @register [&lt;prefix&gt;] &lt;subpropdir&gt;
    Lists registrations in &lt;subpropdir&gt; in the target propdir.
  @register [&lt;prefix&gt;] &lt;object&gt; = &lt;regname&gt;
    Registers &lt;regname&gt; to &lt;object&gt; in the target propdir.
  @register [&lt;prefix&gt;] = &lt;regname&gt;
    Removes registration of &lt;regname&gt; in the target propdir.
</pre>

<h3 id="@chown">@CHOWN &lt;object&gt; [=&lt;player&gt;]
<br>

<br>
</h3>
  Changes the ownership of &lt;object&gt; to &lt;player&gt;, or if no player is given,
to yourself.  Any player is allowed to take possession of objects, rooms, and
actions, provided the CHOWN_OK flag is set.  Mortals cannot take ownership of
a room unless they are standing in it, and may not take ownership of an object unless
they are holding it.  Wizards have absolute power over all ownership.

<br>
</h3>
  Moves &lt;arg1&gt; to &lt;destination&gt;, if &lt;destination&gt; is not given, moves you
to &lt;arg1&gt;.  Wizards may teleport anything to anywhere, provided it makes
sense, and mortals are allowed to do two things: teleport rooms to change
their parent fields, and they may teleport things to a room they can link
to, provided they control either the thing or its location.
<!-- HTML_TOPICEND -->


<h3 id="@stats">@STATS [&lt;player&gt;]
<br>

<br>
</h3>
  For mortal players, returns the highest number in
the database, which includes garbage that has been generated with
@recycle.  For Wizards, gives this number as well as a breakdown of
each type of object: rooms, exits, things, programs, players, and
garbage.  Wizards may also specify &lt;player&gt; which returns a similar
display limited to the possessions of &lt;player&gt;.
<!-- HTML_TOPICEND -->


<h3 id="timestamps">Timestamps:
<br>

<br>
</h3>
  Every object has a timestamp, which includes the time last used, the
time last modified, the time the object was created, and the number
of times that that object has been used by a player. They are shown by
using EXAMINE. 'Usage' is defined as follows: Players-when they are
connected, Rooms-when entered or 'look'd at, Exits-when invoked (by a
'go' command) or 'look'd at, Things-when 'look'd at or 'take'n/'drop'd,
Programs-when run by a player. Examining an object does not count as
looking at them.
<!-- HTML_TOPICEND -->


<h3 id="@find">@FIND [&lt;name&gt;] [= &lt;flags/types&gt; = [&lt;output type&gt;]]
<br>

<br>
</h3>
  Searches through the database for items that you control matching &lt;name&gt;.
Players control only objects they own; wizards control all objects, so @find
searches the entire database when they use it.  Because the command is
computationally expensive, this costs 100 pennies.
<p>
  
<p>
  Flags or types can be specified, to specify that you only want to list
objects that have that flag set, or that are of that type.  You can also
specify to list objects that are NOT of that specific type, or that do
NOT have that flag.  (A &quot;!&quot; before the modifier indicates that it is to
be inverted.)
<p>
  
The flags that you can specify are:  (use the initial capitalized letter only)
<p>
  Abode, Builder/Block, Chown_ok, Dark/Debug, Haven, Interactive, Jump_ok,
<p>
  Kill_ok, Link_ok, Mucker, Quell, Sticky/Silent, Vehicle, Wizard, Xforcible,
<p>
  and Zombie.
<p>
  
You can also specify Mucker Levels by the level number: 1, 2, 3, or 4.
<p>
  
The types that you can specify are: (use the capitalized letter only)
<p>
  Exit, muF program, Player, Room, and Thing.
<p>
  
There are a few other modifiers you can specify: (use only initial character)
<p>
  Unlinked   will specify that you want to list only unlinked objects.
<p>
  @          specifies to list objects longer than about 90 days old.
<p>
  ~size      will match all objs whose current memory usage is greater than
<p>
               or equal to size bytes.  This must be the last modifier in the
<p>
               list of modifiers.
<p>
  ^size      will match all objs whose total memory usage, when fully loaded,
<p>
               is greater than size bytes.  To do this, it loads the entire
<p>
               object into memory from disk.  This modifier is only available
<p>
               to wizards.  For regular players, this acts like ~size.  This
<p>
               must be the last modifier in the list of modifiers.
<p>
  
The output types that can be given are owners, links, size, count, &amp; location.
<p>
  (You use the whole name for output type, and you can use only one at a time.)
<p>
  owners    lists who owns each object.
<p>
  links     shows what each object is linked to, or *UNLINKED*, or, for exits
<p>
              linked to multiple things, *METALINK*
<p>
  size      displays how much memory is currently being used by an object.  If
<p>
              this option is used with the ^ modifier, (see above) then this
<p>
              will display the true full size of the object, and not just how
<p>
              much is currently being used.
<p>
  count     causes nothing to be shown but how many objects the @find/etc would
<p>
              match.  ie:  it doesn't display any of the matched objects.
<p>
  location  shows where the object is located at.
<p>
  
The matching on names is as follows:
<p>
        Individual words can be matched as {word1|word2|...}
<p>
        Individual characters can be matched as [abc...]
<p>
        A ? matches any character.
<p>
        A * matches any number of characters, including none.
<p>
        Any of these special charcters can be matched by putting a \ before it.
<p>
  
Examples of use:
<pre>
    &quot;@find north = EU = location&quot; will find all of your unlinked exits named
        &quot;north&quot; and print them along with their locations.
    &quot;@find {big|little} = R!L&quot; finds all your rooms whose names contain &quot;big&quot;
        or &quot;little&quot; and are not LINK_OK.
    &quot;@find w[ei]ll&quot; will find everything you control whose name contains &quot;will&quot;
        or &quot;well.&quot;
    &quot;@find =E=links&quot; will list all exits that you control, and display where
        they are linked to.
    &quot;@find button==locations&quot; will list all objects you control with 'button'
        in the name, and it will display where thay are located at.
    &quot;@find =~2000=size&quot; will list all your objects whose current memory usage
        is 2000 bytes or more, and it will display their size.
    &quot;@find =^2000=size&quot; will, for a wizard, find all objects in the db that are
        2000 or more bytes in total size, when fully loaded, and it will show
        their sizes.  Note that this will load all of each object into memory
        to make the size determination.  On some systems this can take a while,
        and on all systems this is an abuse to the diskbasing cache.  Only
        Wizards may use this search feature.

<h3 id="abode">@SET here=A
<br>

<br>
</h3>
  If a room is set ABODE, players can set their homes there,
and can set the homes of objects there. (LINK_OK is now used only for exits,
and ABODE is for players and objects.)
<p>
  When set on a program, it means AUTOSTART.  This means that when the game
is first started up, the program will automatically be run with a trigger
of #-1 and a 'me @' of the owner of the program.  This is useful to restart
processes that run in the background periodically.
<!-- HTML_TOPICEND -->


<h3 id="builder">@SET &lt;thing&gt;=B
<br>

<br>
</h3>
  Some mud restrict building commands to players whose builder flag is
set.  The builder flag, BUILDER, is only meaningful for players. On such
systems, only builders can @create, @dig, @link, @open, or take control of
unlinked exits. Only a wizard can set this flag.

<p>
  When BUILDER is set on a program, it is called &quot;BOUND&quot; and it causes any
functions within the program to run in preempt mode, regardless of the
multitasking mode that the process had before calling this program.  When
the execution exits this program, the multitasking mode returns to what
it was before the function was called.  This lets libraries of atomic
functions be written.

<p>
  This flag is also called BOUND when it is set on rooms. An exit attached to
a thing or player and linked to a player or room will not work when the object
to which it is attached is in a room set BOUND.
<!-- HTML_TOPICEND -->


<h3 id="chown_ok">@SET here=C
<br>

<br>
</h3>
  When set on rooms, exit and things, the C flag indicates that any player
may use the @chown command to claim ownership of the item. (see @chown)
When the C flag is set on a player, this indicates that the player wishes
to receive ANSI Color codes from the server.
<!-- HTML_TOPICEND -->


<h3 id="dark">@SET here=D
<br>

<br>
</h3>
  If a room is DARK, then when people besides the owner 'look' there, they only
see things they own. If a thing or player is DARK, then &quot;look&quot; does not list
that object in the room's Contents:. Players can set rooms they own dark, and
may also set objects they own dark, but they cannot drop dark objects in rooms
they don't control. Wizards can set players dark.
When a program is set DARK, it is called DEBUG, and a running stack trace is
printed out to any users of the program for each instruction executes.
<!-- HTML_TOPICEND -->


<h3 id="overt">@set here=O
<br>

<br>
</h3>
  If you set a room to 'Yield', exit matching will NOT continue up the
environment chain.  The only exception to this are any exits on an area
up the environment chain that has been set to be 'Overt'.  By setting a
room both Yield and Bound, you can limit players to -only- those exits
set on the room itself (assuming there are no Overt rooms further up the
env chain).
<!-- HTML_TOPICEND -->


<h3 id="yield">@set here=Y
<br>

<br>
</h3>
  If you set a room to 'Yield', exit matching will NOT continue up the
environment chain.  The only exception to this are any exits on an area
up the environment chain that has been set to be 'Overt'.  By setting a
room both Yield and Bound, you can limit players to -only- those exits
set on the room itself (assuming there are no Overt rooms further up the
env chain).
<!-- HTML_TOPICEND -->


<h3 id="flags">The flags are displayed as letters following an object's ID number.
<br>
Flags are set with the @set command. The flags are: W(izard), S(ticky),
<br>
L(ink_OK), D(ark), J(ump_OK), K(ill_OK), C(hown_OK), H(aven), A(bode),
<br>
B(uilder), V(ehicle), Z(ombie), and The flags R(oom), E(xit), and
<br>
P(layer) are also used.  Debug is the same flag as Dark, Silent as Sticky,
<br>
Color as Chown_OK, and Bound as Builder.  F refers to a Muck Forth program.
<br>
An M followed by a 1, 2, or 3 gives the Mucker Level.  (Priority Level for
<br>
exits.) See TYPES, GENDER, and individual flag names.
<br>
<!-- HTML_TOPICEND -->


<h3 id="haven">@SET here=H
<br>

<br>
</h3>
  If a room is HAVEN, you cannot kill in that room. If a player is set
HAVEN, he cannot be paged. (see page) HAVEN, when set on a program is
called HARDUID, and causes that program to run with the permissions of
the owner of the trigger, rather than with the permissions of the user
of the program.  When this is set in conjunction with the STICKY (SETUID)
flag on a program, and the program is owned by a wizard, then it will run
with the effective mucker level and permissions of the calling program.
If the caller was not a program, or the current program is NOT owned by
a wizard, then it runs with SETUID permissions.
<!-- HTML_TOPICEND -->


<h3 id="jump_ok">@SET here=J
<br>

<br>
</h3>
  The Jump_OK flag is used in several ways.  Unprivileged programs cannot
use MOVETO on an object unless the player either controls the object, the
room it's being moved from, and the room it's being moved to, or else they
are set Jump_OK.  A player cannot use an action that is linked to another
player unless the other player is set Jump_OK.  On some systems, where
SECURE_TELEPORTing is set up, you cannot use an action to leave a room,
unless the action is either attached to that room, or the room is JUMP_OK.
<!-- HTML_TOPICEND -->


<h3 id="kill_ok">@SET here=K
<br>

<br>
</h3>
  On systems where the KILL_OK flag is used, it may restrict combat.
<!-- HTML_TOPICEND -->


<h3 id="link_ok">@SET here=L
<br>

<br>
</h3>
  If a room is LINK_OK, anyone can link exits to it (but still not from it).
It has no meaning for people, things, or exits. See @LINK in the dictionary.
A program that is link_ok can be called by any other program, and can be run
from actions and propqueues not owned by the owner of the program.
<!-- HTML_TOPICEND -->


<h3 id="mucker">Mucker Levels:
<br>

<br>
</h3>
  The mucker level of a player or program specifies whether or not a player
can make MUF programs, and what permissions they will have when the programs
are run.  (See 'man mucker levels')  Only a wizard may set the mucker level
of a player, and a normal player may only set the mucker level of programs
they own to less than their current mucker level.  A program cannot be set
to mucker level 0, since it doesn't mean anything.
<p>
  
<p>
  When the mucker level of an exit is set, is it called the exit's priority
level.  The priority levels let you specify that certain exits are not
overidable by local actions.  When an exit is searched for, in the
matching routines, it will match like it used to, except that if it finds
an exit, later in the search order, that has a higher priority level, it
will choose that exit instead.
<p>
  
<p>
  You can set the priority level of an exit by setting its Mucker Level.
(ie: @set exit=2)  A level of 0 is the lowest priority, and a level of 3
is the highest priority.  Only a Wizard can set the priority level of an
action or exit.
<p>
  
<p>
  When the server looks for the standard &quot;connect&quot;, &quot;disconnect&quot;, or &quot;look&quot;
actions, it will ignore any actions with a priority Level of 0.  When an
action is @attached to another object, @named to something else, or
@unlinked, its Priority Level is reset to 0.
<p>
  
<p>
  If COMPATIBLE_PRIORITIES is #defined on your system, then exits that are
on room or player objects will never act as if they have an effective
priority level of less than 1.
<!-- HTML_TOPICEND -->


<h3 id="quell">@SET here=Q
<br>

<br>
</h3>
  A wizard set QUELL is effectively a normal player with no wizardly powers.
Programs that test to see if a player is wizard will get a false response
from '&quot;wizard&quot; flag?' when the player is QUELLed.  Wiz-bitted programs
will still act wizbitted whether or not the owner is QUELLED.
<!-- HTML_TOPICEND -->


<h3 id="sticky">@SET here=S
<br>

<br>
</h3>
  If a thing is STICKY, it goes home when dropped (See HOMES). If a room is
STICKY, its drop-to is delayed until the last person leaves (See DROP-TO).
If a player is STICKY (SILENT), they don't see the dbrefs on things they
own, and they do not see dark objects.  If an exit is linked to a Thing,
and it is located on another Thing, then if the exit is not STICKY, the
Thing the exit is located on will go home when the exit is triggered.  If
a program is STICKY (SETUID) it runs with the permissions of the owner of
the program, not the perms of the user.

<p>
  A player can set themselves &quot;SILENT&quot; and not see all the dbrefs and dark
objects that they own.  They won't see objects in a dark room either.
They still control the objects though.  Silent is the same flag as STICKY.
<!-- HTML_TOPICEND -->


<h3 id="vehicle">@SET &lt;thing&gt;=V
<br>

<br>
</h3>
  Objects of TYPE_THING, that have the VEHICLE flag set, can contain
players.  To enter a vehicle, you can either use a MUF program to
teleport you to it via MOVETO, you can get a wizard to @teleport you
into it, or else you an use an action that is both attached and linked
to the vehicle to enter it.  This means that you can only enter a vehicle
from the same room that it is in, and you cannot use far links to enter
it.  This prevents the use of vehicles to get around locks.  Inside the
vehicle, you will see its @idesc, instead of its @desc, and you will
not be shown its @succ or @fail.  Objects dropped in a vehicle will not
go away to the their homes, as a vehicle cannot have a dropto set in it.  
Things with the VEHICLE flag set cannot enter rooms or use exits that
have the VEHICLE flag set.  This allows a way to prevent vehicles from
entering areas where it would be illogical for them to be.
When VEHICLE is set on a program, it is called VIEWABLE, and enables the
program to be @listed.
<!-- HTML_TOPICEND -->


<h3 id="wizard">@SET &lt;thing&gt;=W
<br>

<br>
</h3>
  If a person is WIZARD, they are a wizard, unkillable, subject to fewer
restrictions, and able to use wizard commands. It is only meaningful for
players and programs. In general, WIZARDs can do anything using #&lt;number&gt;
or *&lt;player&gt;.  Only player #1 can set and unset the WIZARD flag of other
players if GOD_PRIV is used.
<!-- HTML_TOPICEND -->


<h3 id="xforcible">@SET &lt;thing&gt;=X
<br>

<br>
</h3>
  A thing or player set XFORCIBLE can be forced by anything passing its
force-lock. When the @tune enable_prefix is on, wizards may set this flag
on any wizard-owned action to allow matching on the beginning of the user's
command string, much like the builtin '&quot;' and ':'. The flag is named XPRESS
when used in this way.
<!-- HTML_TOPICEND -->


<h3 id="zombie">@SET &lt;thing&gt;=Z
<br>

<br>
</h3>
  @force and the FORCE muf primitive can be used on objects of type
THING, if they have the ZOMBIE flag set.  Objects act as if they
have the permissions of their owner.  If an object is locked against
a player, it will also be locked against anything that that player
owns, that tries to test the lock.
<p>
  
<p>
 Things with the ZOMBIE flag set cannot enter rooms or use exits that
have the ZOMBIE flag set.  This allows a way to prevent zombies from
entering areas where they are not wanted.
<p>
  
<p>
 If you try to run a program that you control, that has its ZOMBIE flag
set, it will drop you into the MUF debugger.  This lets you step line
by line, or instruction by instruction through a muf program, setting
breakpoints to stop at, and other nice things.  There is help available
within the debugger, via the 'help' command.

<h3 id="propdirs">Properties are stored in AVL trees, and organized into directories of
<br>
</h3>
  properties.  This speeds things up, and keeps you from being spammed on
<p>
  examines.  To examine the properties on an object, use 'ex &lt;obj&gt;=&lt;propdir&gt;'.
<p>
  where to examine the base properties in an object, &lt;propdir&gt; would be '/'.
<p>
  You can see the value of a single property with 'ex &lt;object&gt;=&lt;propname&gt;'.
<p>
      Propdirs are a method of storing and organizing properties to speed
<p>
    access and to provide a sort of built-in organization.  The basic idea
<p>
    is to make something similar to a 'filesystem' for properties.  In this
<p>
    analogy, each person would be a filesystem, with a root directory and
<p>
    (theoretically) an infinite number of properties beneath that.
<p>
      A property has been expanded with the idea that each property may now
<p>
    contain a new property list -- the 'propdir'.  properties can both have
<p>
    a value (either integer or string as before) _and_ contain other
<p>
    properties.
<p>
      The actual directory entries may ALSO contain data.  Propdirs' only
<p>
    real 'visible' changes are in the names of properties -- '/' is used as
<p>
    the property directory separator, and so will not appear in the names
<p>
    of the properties when listed through 'examine' or MUF programs.
<p>
      Property protections have also been expanded -- the . and _ may appear
<p>
    either at the beginning of the property name or immediately following a
<p>
    '/', and that property will have the appropriate protections.  For
<p>
    example, the property '/mail/.inbox/mesg/#' would have the same
<p>
    protections as '.mesg#' would now.
<p>
    There are two ways to remove a property list:
<p>
      * First, and most straight forward, is to remove the property that
<p>
        contains it.  so, in the previous example, removing the property
<p>
        '/mail/.inbox' would (recursively) remove all properties under
<p>
        .inbox before removing .inbox itself.
<p>
      * The second way is to remove all properties within the property list
<p>
        yourself.  When the last property is removed, the parent property
<p>
        (the one that contained the property list) is examined to see if
<p>
        contains data.  If it does, then the property list only is
<p>
        removed.  If the property doesn't contain data then it is removed
<p>
        also.
<p>
      Because of the first method of removing propdirs, the ability to have a
<p>
    property list and value in the same property should be used sparingly.
<p>
      If you try to access a property ending in '/', in MUF, it will give a
<p>
    programmer error, except in NEXTPROP, in which it will give the name of
<p>
    the first property in that propdir.
<p>
      The last visible, non-MUF change that propdirs bring is that 'examine'
<p>
    will no longer show properties _directly_.  Instead, where the properties
<p>
    would normally be shown, it will say:
<p>
        &quot;[ Use 'examine &lt;object&gt;=/' to list root properties. ]&quot;
<p>
      Examine now can take an argument which is the property or propdir to
<p>
    view.  If the property name given ends with a '/', all properties in
<p>
    property directory will be listed, otherwise the single property named
<p>
    will be shown.
<p>
      Internally, a few things changed.  property lists are now stored as AVL
<p>
    trees instead of straight lists, so there is a speed increase even if
<p>
    propdirs are not directly used.  This also means properties are kept in
<p>
    sorted order and will be displayed that way.
<p>
      'addprop' will no longer allow a &quot;:&quot; in the property name.
<p>
      To clear a propdir's value without deleting the proptree below it,
<p>
    from MUF do a '&quot;&quot; 0 addprop' to it.
<p>
      A property can *not* have both a string and integer stored at the same
<p>
    time anymore.  The old property.c was lax and allowed this, even though
<p>
    the integer value would be lost on dbload.

<h3 id="@pcreate">@PCREATE &lt;player&gt;=&lt;password&gt;
<br>

<br>
</h3>
  Only wizards can use this command. This command creates a new player.
It may only be used if REGISTRATION is enabled.
<!-- HTML_TOPICEND -->


<h3 id="@newpassword">@NEWPASSWORD &lt;player&gt; [=&lt;password&gt;]
<br>

<br>
</h3>
  Only wizards may use this command.  Changes &lt;player&gt;'s password,
informing &lt;player&gt; that you changed it. Must be typed in full. If
GOD_PRIV was defined, nobody can change god's password.
<!-- HTML_TOPICEND -->


<h3 id="@force">@FORCE &lt;player|thing&gt;=&lt;command&gt;
<br>

<br>
</h3>
  Causes the game to process &lt;command&gt; as if it were typed by &lt;player|thing&gt;.
If the player or thing being forced is set Xforcible, and its @flock force
lock is set, then anyone (or any zombie) that passed that lock can use @force
on them.  Otherwise only a wizard can use @flock on them.

<p>
  With the compile option GOD_PRIV, God cannot be forced by anything except
God owned, wizbit programs.
<!-- HTML_TOPICEND -->


<h3 id="@boot">@BOOT &lt;player&gt;
<br>

<br>
</h3>
  Disconnects a player from the game.  If a player is connected more than
once it affects the most recent connection. Only a wizard may use this
command.
<!-- HTML_TOPICEND -->


<h3 id="@toad">@TOAD &lt;player1&gt; = &lt;player2&gt;
<br>

<br>
</h3>
  Only wizards may use this command.  Turns &lt;player1&gt; into a slimy toad,
destroying their character.  All possessions of &lt;player1&gt; are @chowned to
&lt;player2&gt;.  Must be typed in full.
<!-- HTML_TOPICEND -->


<h3 id="@bless">@BLESS &lt;obj&gt;=&lt;proppattern&gt;
<br>
</h3>
  
<p>
  This is a wizard-only command.
<p>
  
<p>
  Blesses all properties on &lt;obj&gt; that match the given &lt;proppattern&gt; wildcard
pattern.  The wildcard pattern works similarly to how the examine patterns
work.  ie:

<pre>
  @bless obj=/**      blesses ALL properties on obj.
  @bless obj=foo/**   blesses all props in the foo/ propdir, and all propdirs
                       under the foo/ propdir, recursively.
  @bless obj=foo*bar  blesses all root props whose name start with foo and end
                       with bar.
</pre>

<p>
 The @bless command will list all properties that it blesses.

<p>
  Blessed properties can execute MPI code with elevated permissions, allowing
scripts that can alter remote objects, and those objects not controlled by
the trigger owner.  Blessed MPI can also use {force} on anyone.

<p>
  Blessed _msgmacs properties don't execute with blessed permissions when they
are referenced from other MPI code.  Instead, the bless bit on _msgmacs props
indicates only that that macro is available to scripts up the environment,
even if the script's trigger is not the same as the owner of the environment
room the _msgmacs prop is on.
<!-- HTML_TOPICEND -->


<h3 id="@unbless">@UNBLESS &lt;obj&gt;=&lt;proppattern&gt;
<br>
</h3>
  
<p>
  This is a wizard-only command.
<p>
  
<p>
  Unblesses all properties on &lt;obj&gt; that match the given &lt;proppattern&gt;
wildcard pattern.  The wildcard pattern works similarly to how the examine
patterns work.  Ie:

<pre>
  @unbless obj=/**      unblesses ALL properties on obj.
  @unbless obj=foo/**   unblesses all props in the foo/ propdir, and all
                         propdirs under the foo/ propdir, recursively.
  @unbless obj=foo*bar  unblesses all root props whose name start with foo
                         and end with bar.
</pre>

<p>
  The @unbless command will list all properties that it unblesses.

<p>
  Blessed properties can execute MPI code with elevated permissions, allowing
scripts that can alter remote objects, and those objects not controlled by
the trigger owner.  Blessed MPI can also use {force} on anyone.

<p>
  Blessed _msgmacs properties don't execute with blessed permissions when they
are referenced from other MPI code.  Instead, the bless bit on _msgmacs props
indicates only that that macro is available to scripts up the environment,
even if the script's trigger is not the same as the owner of the environment
room the _msgmacs prop is on.
<!-- HTML_TOPICEND -->


<h3 id="@wall">@WALL &lt;message&gt;
<br>

<br>
</h3>
  Only wizards may use this command. Shouts something to every
player connected. Must be typed in full.
<!-- HTML_TOPICEND -->


<h3 id="@dump">@DUMP [filename]
<br>

<br>
</h3>
  Only wizards may use this command. Saves the database from memory to disk.
Automatically occurs every three hours, and when @shutdown is used. It does
slow down the server, so only use if you fear a server crash is iminent.
If a filename is given, it will save the db to that file, and save any
subsequent dumps to it as well.
<!-- HTML_TOPICEND -->


<h3 id="@shutdown">@SHUTDOWN
<br>

<br>
</h3>
  Shuts down the game.  Only wizards may use this command, and it
must be typed in full.
<p>Also see:
    <a href="#@restart">@RESTART</a> and
    <a href="#@armageddon">@ARMAGEDDON</a>
</p>
<!-- HTML_TOPICEND -->


<h3 id="@restart">@RESTART
<br>

<br>
</h3>
  Initiate a full shutdown and restart of the Muck server.  Only
wizards may use this command.
<p>Also see:
    <a href="#@shutdown">@SHUTDOWN</a> and
    <a href="#@armageddon">@ARMAGEDDON</a>
</p>
<!-- HTML_TOPICEND -->


<h3 id="@armageddon">@ARMAGEDDON [&lt;reason&gt;]
<br>

<br>
</h3>
  Initiates an immediate emergency shutdown of the Muck server, and does
NOT save the database out to disk.  Use this ONLY when you suspect the
database has been corrupted, and it would be a BAD thing to save the
database out to disk.  This is a wizard-only command.

<p>
  Examples:
<pre>
    @armageddon                  force shutdown server
    @armageddon World ending!    force shutdown with given reason
</pre>
<p>Also see:

</p>
<!-- HTML_TOPICEND -->


<h3 id="@restrict">@RESTRICT [on|off]
<br>

<br>
</h3>
  Manages restriction of logins, turning on or off maintenance wiz-only login
mode.  With no args, @restrict will print out the current login restriction
state.  With an argument of 'on', maintenance mode is turned on, and only
wizards can log in.  With an argument of 'off', restricted login mode is turned
off, and all players can log in.  NOTE: when the muck starts up in sanfix mode,
with a corrupted database, it will be with @restricted logins.
<!-- HTML_TOPICEND -->


<h3 id="@uncompile">@UNCOMPILE
<br>

<br>
</h3>
  Uncompiles all programs, removing them from memory.
<!-- HTML_TOPICEND -->


<h3 id="@reconfiguressl">@RECONFIGURESSL
<br>

<br>
</h3>
  Only wizards may use this command.  Attempt to reread SSL certificate files
and reset SSL options from @tune settings.  If it fails (for example,
the new certificate file is not usable), old settings will persist. Must be
typed in full.
<!-- HTML_TOPICEND -->


<h3 id="@tune">@TUNE
<br>
@TUNE info
<br>
@TUNE &lt;param&gt; [=&lt;value&gt;]

<br>

<br>
</h3>
  View and modify tunable parameters that configure how the server operates,
or provide help on a specific parameter.

<p>
  This is a wizard-only command.

<p>
  Examples:
<pre>
    @tune              shows all parameters and their values
    @tune info         shows all parameters, values, and brief descriptions
    @tune foo          shows the value of foo
    @tune foo=bar      sets the value of foo to bar
    @tune %foo         resets foo to the default system value
    @tune info foo     briefly describes foo
</pre>

<p>
  Some parameters may require a @RESTART or reload to apply.
<!-- HTML_TOPICEND -->


<h3 id="@credits">@CREDITS
<br>

<br>
</h3>
