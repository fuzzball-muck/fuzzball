20XX-MM-DD
Lets fill this out before beta 2 is tagged for release
TODO: possibly further un-markdown-ify this file to improve readability.  Interestingly enough, what little I (maine coon) have already done shows that some markdown hasn't been correctly used, thus causing the rendered release pages on GitHub to not look as intended.


7.00b1
2017-12-16
## Miscellaneous
- Refactored numerous sections of server code to be more developer-friendly.
- Fixed a significant number of memory leaks and potential crash situations.

## System parameters

### New
- file_log_malloc. Log file for memory allocations. Defaults to "log/malloc".
- pname_history_reporting. If no, PNAME_HISTORY returns an empty dictionary. Defaults to yes.
- pname_history_threshold. Timespan of player name history to keep, "0s" is unlimited. Defaults to 30 days.

### Removed
- who_doing. Now always on.

## Commands

### New
- `@register`. Replaces popular softcoded command.
- uptime. Displays time since server reboot.

### Changed
- `@contents`, `@entrances`, `@find`, `@kill`, `@owned`, `@ps`, `@sweep`, `@trace`. Now NOGUEST, BUILDER-ONLY.
- `@examine`. Now allows object matching.
- `@list`. Added prefix options to control line number listing. Now NOGUEST,  PLAYER-ONLY.
- `@sanchange`, `@sanfix`. Can no longer be FORCEd.
- `@teleport`. Now NOGUEST.
- `@tune`. Now allows $reg-matching.

### Additional syntax for setting standard locks/properties
@desc
	shows player's description
@desc [object]
	shows [object]'s description
@desc [object] =
	removes [object]'s description
@desc =
	removes player's description
@desc [object]=[text]
	sets [object]'s description to [text]
@desc = [text]
	sets player's description to [text]

### Matching
- Standard match messages now display the unmatched string.
- Many more commands now use standard match messages.
- Logic now prefers matching on objects that are more "local" to the player.

## MUF 

### New
- $DOCCMD. Populates the _docs property of the program.
- $LANGUAGE. Sets compilation language.
- __PROG__. A compile-time token that is replaced by the dbref of the current program. Currently recognized in $DOCCMD and $PUBDEF directives.
- CASE, DEFAULT, END, ENDCASE, WHEN. Promoted from popular library to in-server $defines.
- READ_WANTS_NO_BLANKS. Turns off READ_WANTS_BLANKS setting.

### Array pinning

When an array is pinned, changes to any dup'ed copy on the stack will make changes to ALL copies. New (or recently-exposed) primitives that support this feature include ARRAY_DEFAULT_PINNING, ARRAY_PIN, ARRAY_UNPIN, DEEP_COPY, and SHALLOW_COPY.

### Changed
- GETPIDINFO. Returned dictionary now contains an "mlevel" key.
- MLEVEL. If the argument is #-1, returns the current program's effective MUCKER level.
- PNAME_HISTORY. Now keeps a limited history, and player name at creation is tracked with the "created_as" property.
- REGSPLIT[_NOEMPTY]. Now requires a third "flags" argument, as other regex primitives do.
- STRIP. Promoted from in-server $define to primitive.
- SYSPARM_ARRAY. Returned dictionary now contains the previous "mlev" key - copy of "readmlev".

## MPI

### Changed
- {date}, {time}. Now aborts when the time value cannot be resolved.

## MCP

### New Packages
- org-fuzzball-languages. Returns list of supported languages.


7.00a3
2017-04-01
## Miscellaneous
- Refactored numerous sections of server code to be more developer-friendly.
- Fixed a significant number of memory leaks and potential crash situations.

## System parameters

### New
- muf_string_math. Previously compile-time #define STRINGMATH, defaulting to no. In addition to modifying the "=" MUF primitive to check string equality, the primitives "+" and "*" can now add and multiply strings.
- player_name_limit. Previously compile-time #define PLAYER_NAME_LIMIT, defaulting to 16. Limits player name length.
- verbose_examine. Previously compile-time #define VERBOSE_EXAMINE, defaulting to yes. Shows flag descriptions in examine command output.

### Changed
- file_ parameters are now readable by #1 only.

## Commands

### New
- @readlock. Enables bypassing of non-MUF read permissions.
- @ownlock. Enables bypassing of "controls" checks.

### Changed
- @debug. Absorbed @dbginfo as "@debug display propcache". Wizard only.
- @sweep. Now can report any exit, not just one linked to a program.
- @clone, @mcpprogram, @progam. Now can assign to a $regname.

## MUF Primitives

### New
- -ROT ( x y z -- z x y ). Rotates the top three things on the stack, in reverse.
- NIP ( x y -- y ). Pops the second item off the stack.
- TUCK ( x y -- y x y ). Duplicates y and places it under x.
- ?DUP ( x -- x x | x ). Duplicates the item at the top of the stack if it does not resolve to false.
- PNAME_HISTORY ( d -- a ).   Returns a dictionary repesenting the times when the given player had a name change, including creation.  If an associated time cannot be determined, that key is 0.  Requires Wizbit.

### Changed
- NEXT_PROP_NAME. Now returns a slash-prefixed property when given the empty string as an argument.
- STOD. Now more consistently returns #-1 for non-numbers.

### Optimizations, mostly from ProtoMUCK.
- [ "" strcmp 0 = ] or [ "" stringcmp 0 = ] => [ not ]
- [ 1 pick ] => [ dup ]
- [ 2 pick ] => [ over ]
- [ 3 rotate ] => [ rot ]
- [ 2 rotate ] or [ -2 rotate ] => [ swap ]
- [ 1 rotate ] or [ 0 rotate ] or [ -1 rotate ] => (nothing)
- [ rot rot ] => [ -rot ]
- [ -rot -rot ] => [ rot ]
- [ swap pop ] => [ nip ]

## Server
- Added "-nodetach" option, replacing compile-time #define DETACH (which is now defaulted).
- Added "-bindv4 [address]" option, setting the listening address for IPv4 sockets - defaulting to all.
- Added "-bindv6 [address]" option, setting the listening address for IPv6 sockets - defaulting to all.
- Added "-resolver [path]" option, setting the path to the resolver program.
- Incorporated rudimentary token replacement into in-server documentation system, allowing dynamic entry creation (see "man sysparm").
- Disabled bypassing the automatic look command by setting a "connect" action STICKY.
