( Set of library routines for doing 'look' functions. )
( The following functions are included in this library:
  safecall:  x d --
       Takes a dbref which is assumed to be a command or @desc-like program
       that takes one parameter, usually a string, and returns no values.]
       It ensures that none of the variables me, loc, trigger, or command
       are modified, and that no garbage is left behind on the stack.
  unparse:  d -- s
       Takes a dbref, and returns either just its name, or the name plus
       flags, depending on the permissions of me @.
  contents-filter:  a d -- d... i
       Takes the address of a 'filter' routine and a dbref, and returns a
       range on the stack of the filtered contents of the object.  The first
       item to print is the bottom of the stack range.  The filter should
       be  d -- i; it takes a dbref and returns a true/false value to say
       whether or not the dbref should be put into the list.
  get-contents:  d -- d... i
       Takes a dbref, and returns the list of its contents, filtered through
       the standard filter which acts like the server's contents list:
       Dark rooms don't list anything unless the room or the objects are
       yours, dark objects not owned by you don't show, and you don't show.
       This list has the first element in the contents at the bottom of the
       stack.
  long-display:  d... i --
       List the dbref stack range given, in the usual format for the server.
       All elements on separate lines, using unparse.  The bottom element is
       printed first.
  short-list:  d... i -- s
       Turns the range of dbrefs on the stack into a properly formatted
       string, with commas.  1 element is just returned, 2 elements returns
       '1 and 2', more elements return '1, 2, 3, and 4' or similar.  Returns
       a null string if there are no elements.  Again, the bottom element is
       first in the list.
  short-display:  d... i --
       Calls short-list, then prints out "You see <string>." to the user.
       Prints "You see nothing." if nothing is on the list.
  list-contents:  s d --
       Calls get-contents followed by long-display to print out all of the
       contents of the given dbref.  If there are any contents listed, then
       the string on the stack is printed out, for "Contents:" or the like.
       If the contents list is empty, the string is ignored.
  str-desc:  s --
       Takes string 's', and prints it out as a description.  Matches the
       '@###' and '@$prog' values properly, and uses them with the present
       trigger value.  If neither of these exist, or if they're invalid,
       the rest of the string is just printed out.
  dbstr-desc:  d s --
       Runs str-desc, using the value d on the stack as the effective
       trigger value.
  db-desc:  d --
       Does a full description of the object, including name and succ/fail
       if the dbref given is a room, and contents.  All programs run with
       the dbref given in 'trigger @'.  Will return the proper values for
       dbref's #-1 and #-2 as well.
  cmd-look:  s --
       Does a match function, then calls db-desc with the results.  This
       will simulate the usual 'look' command.
