  .noisy_match  [ itemname -- itemdbref ]
    Takes a string with a possible item name in it.  It returns the
      dbref of the object is if is found.  If it is not found, it tells
      the user that it doesn't see that here and returns #-1.  If it
      finds several matches it tells the user that it doesn't know which
      item was meant, and returns #-2.
  
  .noisy_pmatch   [ playername -- playerdbref]
    This routine takes a string with a possible playername and returns
      the dbref of that player, if it can find it.  If it cannot find the
      player, then it tells the user that it doesn't know who that is,
      and it returns #-1.
  
  .controls  [ playerdbref objectdbref -- controlled? ]
    This routine takes a player dbref and an object dbref and returns an
      integer value of 1 if the player controls that object.  Otherwise
      it returns a 0.
  
  .match_controlled  [ itemname -- itemdbref ]
    This routine basically does a .noisy_match, and checks that what is
      returned is controlled by the user.  If it is not, then it tells the
      user Permission Denied, and returns #-1.  Otherwise it returns the
      dbref of the item matched.
  
  .multi_rmatch  [objref smatchstr -- dn .. d1 n]
      This function takes a dbref for the thing/player/room that it is
      to match in, and a smatch style comparison string and returns the
      dbrefs of all the contained objects within who's names matched the
      string.  There is an integer on top giving how many dbrefs were
      returned.  If no items were matched, it only returns a 0.
  
  .table_match  [ xnone xambig sn xn .. s1 x1 n comp func -- smat xmat ]
      This function takes, in order:
          - a data value of any type to return if no matches are made.
              {xnone}
          - a data value of any type to return if the match is amiguous.
              {xambig}
          - a range of comparator {sn - s1}, and data {xn - x1} pairs of
              any type.
          - an integer count of how many comparator-data pairs are on
              the stack to be compared against. {n}
          - a value of the same type as the comparators, that will be
              checked against each comparator.  {comp}
          - the address of the comparator function that is used to compare
              comp against s1 through sn.  This function should take the
              two datums for comparison and return a 1 for a match or a 0
              for a non-match.  {func}
        This function tests comp against s1 through sn, returning the
          matching compatator-data pair if it finds one match.  It returns
          a null string and xnone if no matches are found.  It returns a
          null string and xambig if more than one match was found.
  
  .std_table_match
    This function runs .table_match with a standard comparator fuction that
      expects the comparators to be strings.  The match comparator routine
      matches if comp matches the beginning of the comparator exactly.
      ie:  a comp of "#h" would match a comparator {s1 - sn} of "#help".
