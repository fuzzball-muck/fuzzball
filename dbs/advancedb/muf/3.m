  -= SUMMARY =-
        This only works on FB6. You can check for it by:
                $ifdef __version>Muck2.2fb6
                        do bolding stuff
                $endif
 
        This library includes support for a certain sort of bolding, in which
        anything bracketed by * is converted to bold, and anything bracketed by _
        is converted to underline, by the following rules:
          - The */_ must be preceeded by a space [or be first on the line].
          - The */_ must be followed by a letter or number.
          - There must be a matching */_ on the line to turn it off.
 
        All the bolding and underlining is done by on the RECEIVER side only. The
        person talking/paging/shouting/whatever does not have to do anything
        special, other than use the *bold* formatting as they might anyhow.
        
        Someone who has bolding turned on would see:
                Vash says, "Knives, you <bold>monster</bold>!"
        [where the <bold> </unbold> is shifting to another ANSI color code], and
        anyone who has bolding off would still see:
                Vash says, "Knives, you *monster*!"
 
        This code is formatted for 4-space tab stops. And I tend to format like
        Python [i.e., watch the indenting].
 
  -= LEGALESE =-
        Use this anywhere you want, without asking, just leave this header, please.
        And if you're feeling helpful, you could document your changes down below
        and change the VERSION so people know they're not using a stock version.
 
  -= INSTALLING =-
        This library needs to be set M3.
 
  -= USE =-
        '$include $lib/bolding' in your MUF code.
         [or '$include #dbref-of-the-lib' if it's not global on your MUCK]
 
        You then have access to the following common functions:
        
        BOLD-supported-q[ -- bool:supported ]
                This will be true on FB6+, false otherwise <FB5>. It tells you
                whether the MUCK can even do color.
 
        BOLD-filter[ dbref:who str:message -- str:formatted_message ]
                Filters 'message' based on 'who's settings, which may mean it comes
                back totally unchanged. This will not notify, just return the
                appropriate string.
 
        BOLD-notify[ dbref:who str:message -- ]
                Filters 'message' based on 'who's settings, then notifies.
 
                Note: If calling program is M1, this will prepend the name, just
                like a normal 'notify'.
 
        BOLD-notify-list[ arr:who str:message -- ]
                For each 'who' in the array, filters 'message' appropriately, and
                then notifies them. This doesn't make any sense under FB5, which
                has no arrays.
 
                Note: If calling program is M1, this will prepend the name, just
                like a normal 'notify'.
 
        BOLD-cmd-parse1[ str:cmdarg -- bool:handled ]
                This requires the calling program be at least M3.
                Attempts to parse user input - if it returns handled true, then it
                was caught and handled. See BOLD-cmd-parse2 for details.
        
        BOLD-cmd-parse2[ str:argument str:cmd -- bool:handled ]
                This requires the calling program be at least M3.
                Attempts to parse user input which has already been split up into
                a one word 'cmd' <like '#bold'> and 'argument' <like 'bold,green'>
 
                If handled is true, it handled the input, otherwise it's up to
                you to keep trying to handle it.
 
                It handles the following:
                        #bold                   - turn bolding settings
                        #bold on                - turn bolding on
                        #bold off               - turn bolding off
                        #bold help              - BOLD-cmd-help
                        #bold help2         - advanced help
                        #bold trebuchet - trebuchet specific help
                        #bold-code <attr>  - set bold on code
                        #under-code <attr> - set underline on code
                        #italic-code <attr> - set italic on code <no longer>
                        #off_code <attr>        - set 'turn off' code
 
                <attr> is the same as in 'man textattr' or 'mpi attr'. These will
                set the appropriate user props.
 
                Example, assuming we're split into cmd and arg already:
                        cmd @ "#help" stringcmp not if
                                pop do_help exit then
                        arg @ cmd @ BOLD-cmd-parse2 if 
                                exit then <was handled>
                        "Unrecognized command '%s'." cmd @ "%s" subst .tell
 
        BOLD-cmd-help[ -- ]
                This will show the user #help for the BOLD-cmd-parse* commands. The
                idea is that you can incorporate it into your own #help screens.
                'cmd' is the name of the program/trigger being run. 
 
                Make sure you also call BOLD-cmd-parse1 or BOLD-cmd-parse2 from inside
                your command parsing section, or this does you no good at all!
 
                For example <in a really stupid way>:
                        userinput @ "#help bold" stringcmp not if
                                BOLD-cmd-help exit then 
 
        BOLD-get-settings [ -- str:status ]
                Returns a string that summarizes the current BOLD settings for
                'me @' - from the same routine used to print the status for #bold?
 
 
        Less commonly useful functions:
 
        BOLD-possible-q[ dbref:who -- bool:possible ]
                Returns true if char 'who' can even see color at all. Even if the
                muck supports color, the char might not be set up for it, so
                you would normally call BOLD-active-q instead.
 
        BOLD-active-q[ dbref:who -- bool:active ]
                Returns true if char 'who' has bolding turned on AND they can
                even see color at all.
 
        BOLD-set-active[ dbref:who bool:active -- ]
                Calling program must be m3 to do this. Does not change the
                BOLD-possible-q setting.
                This is still VERY rude to do without the user requesting it.
 
        BOLD-filter-test[ str:message -- str:formatted_message ]
                Filters 'message' with generic codes for 'me @' assuming it can be
                done at all. You should use this only for test messages - do NOT
                override people's settings normally. Like this:
                        "If you can see color at all, *this* should look different."
                        BOLD-filter-test .tell
 
  -= VERSIONS =-

        V0.03   Jul 17 2002 Add trebuchet help, /, escape char in smatch
        V0.04   Jul 19 2002 Get rid of italics, too many problems
        V1.00   Jul 19 2002 Make it sane under FB5, release.
        V1.01   Jul 19 2002 BOLD-notify-list won't tell zombies if owner in list
        V1.02   Jul 26 2002 Make 'C' flag? check on owner instead of puppet
        V1.03   Jul 26 2002 Convert 'active' flag to 'off' flag, default more sense
        V1.04   Jul 26 2002 Get rid of FB5 support. Not worth it.
