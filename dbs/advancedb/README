This is a version of base.db remade with Fuzzball 6 programs. I have included
many programs that were not in the original base.db.

* The database contains two players, One and Keeper. One's password is potrzebie. Keeper's password is yamabiko.
  You should change their passwords immediately:

    connect #1 potrzebie
    @password potrzebie=<One's new password>
    @newpassword Keeper=<Keeper's new password>

  Only One can perform some functions like setting and removing players'
  Wizard flags. Keep its password safe!

  Keeper is for owning general MUCK property such as MUF programs and public
  areas. Programs that need a "force wizard" can use Keeper. Feel free to
  rename Keeper with your MUCK's name or initials.

* There are three environment rooms for public building:

    $env/null    Null Environment Room
    $env/in      Indoor Environment Room
    $env/out     Outdoor Environment Room

  By default new rooms are placed in the Null Environment Room.

* Several MUF program locks are included:

    $lock/nothing      Always fails (also "$nothing").
    $lock/player       Only players (not zombies) pass.
    $lock/wizard       Only un-Quelled Wizard players pass.
    $lock/truewizard   Wizards pass whether Quelled or not.

* Some commands in this database to which you may not be accustomed are:

    alias        Set an alias, like a page #alias, to be used in page,
                 whisper, laston, meetme, etc.
    ansi         Shows an ANSI test pattern; "ansi #on" enables color.
    away         Set an "away" flag that's shown in page, ws, and WHO.
    banish       Allows a room owner to ban players from a room or area.
    feel;taste   Sense verbs like "smell".
    ignore       Operates Fuzzball 6's inserver "ignore" function.
    @muf         Runs short MUF programs, like @mpi.
    programs     Searches for MUF programs set Viewable.
    spam         "spam #no" sets your _nospam?:yes property.
    userlist     Lists players on the MUCK.

  Use "<command> #help" to get documentation on any of them. To use alias and
  away in your own MUF programs, "@view $lib/alias" and "@view $lib/away".
  "@view $lib/table" for another unusual library, for tabular output, as in
  ws, wd, laston, and wizards.

* MUF compatibility libraries for tilde style ("~&110") and GlowMuck style
  ("^red^") ANSI color are provided:

    $include $lib/ansi (for tilde style)
    $include $lib/glowansi (for GlowMuck style)

  Tilde color programs that depend on the tilde color codes being intact after
  performing ANSI operations will not work; however, there are vanishingly few
  such programs. No library is necessary for Fuzzball 6 style raw escape codes
  or the "textattr" primitive.

* Some programs you may find missing are:

    "hug" socials
    Guests


Hope that helps, and enjoy!  --Natasha
