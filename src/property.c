/**
 * Set a property on an object (the 'player'), with name pname and
 * with property data 'dat'.  'sync' has to do with syncing gender
 * props -- more on that in a moment.
 *
 * This method (unlike some others) does full property name validation.
 * Leading / are trimmed off, and if there is a ':' the prop name will
 * be terminated at that point (the : becomes a \0).  The : is defined
 * as PROP_DELIMITER.  
 * 
 * If there is no property name after cleanup, this just returns with nothing
 * done.
 *
 * As for 'dat' ... its flags field is used to initialize the flags on the
 * newly made property.  If the flags field in 'dat' has PROP_ISUNLOADED, then
 * it is set on the prop as-is.  In this way, a diskbase'd property can
 * be set to its diskbase'd value.
 *
 * Otherwise, type is derived from the flags field in dat.  If it is a
 * string, a *copy* of the string is made for the new prop so you should
 * clean up your own string as necessary.
 *
 * Float, int, and dbref are all trivial and just are copied over.  If
 * you create a PROP_DIRTYP (propdir) it must already have props in it.
 * For a LOCK -- and this is very important -- the boolexp lock structure
 * is NOT COPIED and the property 'owns' the lock memory from this point
 * forward.  Do not free it!
 *
 * If you set the property to what is considered an empty value
 * ("" for string, 0 for int, 0.0 for float, or a PROP_DIRTYP with no
 * properties in it), it will be deleted instead.
 *
 * And if this comment wasn't long enough -- we've also got "sync"!
 * "sync" is for some funky logic around the gender property.  If the MUCK's
 * @tune'd gender property is not the same as LEGACY_GENDER_PROP
 * (usually "sex"), and sync is 0, then LEGACY_GENDER_PROP and the tune'd
 * gender property receive the same fate.
 *
 * Thus, if sync is 0, and you set the tune'd gender prop, it will
 * also set LEGACY_GENDER_PROP to the same or vise versa.
 *
 * 'sync' and the behavior surrounding it only applies to players; sync
 * has absolutely no effect on any other type of DB object.
 *
 * There is an additional wrinkle; there is a LEGACY_GUEST_PROP
 * (usually "~/isguest").  If this is deleted, then the GUEST dbflag
 * is removed from the player as well.  This is regardless of the 'sync'
 * setting, and only happens for object type == Player
 *
 * You will typically want to run this with sync = 1.  The original purpose
 * around sync is to avoid a recursion problem.
 *
 * This version of set_property DOES NOT do diskbase -- you probably want
 * to use set_property instead.

 * If the found property is a floating point, it is also compared against

 * comparison but the property is set as an integer.  It could accidentally
 * match the integer instead of the string, which may be a way to bypass
 * locks (as this call seems to be used for locking primarily).

 * @TODO: Code review - would a call such as :
 *        has_property(x, db, db2, "whatever/prop", "PassString", 0)
 *        successfully pass the lock check if the property is an
 *        integer propval '0' instead of 'PassString' which would be
 *        the expected value?  Potential security hole.
 *
 * MPI in string properties is parsed based on a has_prop_recursion_limit
 * static variable.  It looks like a measure to prevent the MPI from
 * causing a loop where has_property calls has_property on the same property
 * downstream.  If the recursion limit is reached, the string property is
