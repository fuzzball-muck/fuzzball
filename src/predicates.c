   huge envchains in order to bring the server down.  We have a loop
   if we:
   a) Try to parent to ourselves.
   b) Parent to nothing (not really a loop, but won't get you to #0).
   c) Parent to our own home (not a valid destination).
   d) Find our source room down the environment chain.
   Note: This system will only work if every step _up_ to this point has
   resulted in a consistent (ie: no loops) environment.
