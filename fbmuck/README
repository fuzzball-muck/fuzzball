This is TinyMUCK 2.2fb6.00 (FuzzBall 6.00), a programmable, player
expandable, multi-user adventure game.  Please see the CHANGES file
for a list of changes from the previous version.

TinyMUCK was derived from TinyMUD v1.5.2, with extensive modifications.
There were two new commands: @action and @attach, and two new flags:
CHOWN_OK and JUMP_OK.  It also has options for users of FireFoot's patches.

Note:   This version of TinyMUCK WILL NO LONGER READ OLDER DATABASES
        WITHOUT TRANSLATION.  A translator program, "fb-olddecompress",
        is provided for all TinyMUD, TinyMUCK, and older Fuzzball TinyMUCK
        databases.  It writes out databases in its own unique format.

Documentation exists in several files, read Documentation to find out
what's what.

I recommend that non-MUF programmers read MUD.doc and MUCK.doc, and
MUF programers read MUF-tutorial, MUF.Manual and forth.ref.
technical.doc should be read by system administrators and people who
wish to hack TinyMUCK.

Note: FuzzBall TinyMUCK is now maintained as a project on SourceForge.
You can submit bugs directly to the developers (as well as put in new
feature requests, and get CVS updates of the source tree) by going to
http://www.sourceforge.net/.  The name of the project 'FuzzBall MUCK 6',
and you can search for it by using the keyword 'fbmuck'.  The
documentation is also maintained on SourceForge under a separate
project, keyword 'fbdoc'.

COMPILING TINYMUCK:

The code is written in ANSI C, and is known to compile and run under
ULTRIX/BSD 4.3/SunOS 4.1 on a VAX 8600, VAX 6400, DEC 3100s/5000s, a
MicroVAX, a Sun SparcStation/1, and a Sun 3/50.  TinyMUCK is also
known to have run on a HP9k260, as well as a NeXT.  Lots of people
run FB under the Debian and RedHat distributions of Linux.  Some developers
also compile and run it on Apple systems (Darwin: ppc and x86_64).

As far as other platforms, you're on your own.

SunOS realloc() is braindead.  On every SunOS system I have seen, TinyMUCK
runs about 6 megs in memory with a very small database if the option
DB_DOUBLING is not defined.  If you are running on a Sun3 or Sun4,
you should definitely compile with this option turned on.  Let me
know if there are other systems that need this.  This may not be as
much of a problem with current versions of the server, as databases now
store a count of their objects, and the entire database generally gets
allocated in one chunk.

To compile fbmuck:
  ./configure --with-ssl    # if you want SSL support.  Otherwise...
  ./configure               # if you don't/can't.
  make                      # to compile fbmuck.
  make install              # to install binaries in /usr/local/bin
  make install-inits        # to install SysV style init scripts.


=========================================================================

PROGRAMS CONTAINED IN THE DISTRIBUTION:

fbmuck

 This is the actual server program; it is invoked as 
    fbmuck [options] starting-dbfile dump-dbfile [portnumber]

 Where the [options] can be:
            -convert       load db, save in current format, and quit.
            -decompress    when saving db, save in uncompressed format.
            -nosanity      don't do db sanity checks at startup time.
            -insanity      load db, then enter interactive sanity editor.
            -wizonly       only allow wizards to login.
            -help          display usage message.

 If port is not specified it defaults to 4201.  The initial database
 will be read in from starting-dbfile, which must contain at least the two
 objects in minimal.db to work well.  The file basedb.db, which contains
 the core of the original TinyMUD universe, may be a better place to
 start a new universe from.  You can fetch basedb.tar.gz from the same
 site you fetched this server code from.  The -decompress option will
 cause the dump-file to be saved in an uncompressed format.  The netmuck
 process will write a checkpoint out to dump-dbfile every few hours,
 depending on the @tuned interval parameter.  The -convert option will
 cause the server to load an old style database, save it back out
 immediately in the most current database format, and then shutdown,
 instead of allowing connections.


restart

 This is a C shell script which starts the netmuck program.
 It is invoked as:

    restart port
 eg.,
    restart 5823

 This will restart the netmuck process to run at port 5823.
 See the shell script for more info.  Make sure you edit the
 restart script to match your directories and db file names.


fb-olddecompress

 Usage: fb-olddecompress < compressed-db-file > uncompressed-db-file
 or: fb-olddecompress compressed-db-file > uncompressed-db-file

 Removes old style bigraph compression from a database file that has been
 generated by an older version of netmuck using the -DCOMPRESS compile-time
 option.


sanity

 This program no longer exists in the current distribution.  It's function has
 been merged into the netmuck program itself.  To invoke the database sanity
 checker, run netmuck with the -insanity option.  This enters the INteractive
 SANITY verification and repair program.  This can be a very dangerous function
 unless you understand how the internal database works.


topwords

 Usage: topwords < db-file | sort > words.txt

 WARNING: DO NOT RUN TOPWORDS MANUALLY UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING.
 This program will find the 4096 (max) words which will give you the best
 compression with the new style dictionary based compression.  This is
 used by the optimdb script to re-optimize the compression of a database.
 If the database you provide has fewer than 4096 words, this will _not_
 return 4096 words and can cause severe problems.  The optimdb script
 takes this into account by using 4096 seed words.  You should use the
 optimdb script instead of running this manually.

 For the sake of all that is holy and sacred, don't use this program
 anymore.  The "new style dictionary based compression" is Dr. Cat's
 compression system implemented in compress.c -- it is known to be
 braindead and was the primary reason why fbmuck was not 8-bit clean
 until March of 2007.

optimdb

 Usage: optimdb infile outfile

 This script reads a database, and saves it out to the outfile with the
 compression optimized.  For databases under a half meg, this db will likely
 be a few K larger than the same database compressed with the old bigraph
 method.  For half a meg and over, though, it's a win.

 Again, don't run this program; see the notes for 'topwords' above to
 understand why.

I hope that you enjoy using TinyMUCK FB.  Please send all bug reports, etc.
to the fbmuck project at sourceforge.net.

PLEASE, send me any patches that you've made so that I can put them
into the next release.  I most definitely do not want tens of thousands
of "patches" out there for TinyMUCK --- it makes it hard for me to make
the database format backward-compatible for your benefit.

When you send me changes, please send diffs from the version of the FB
distribution that you changed.  Use 'diff -cr orig-dir modified-dir'
where orig-dir is the directory with the unmodified stock FB source code,
and modified-dir is the directory with the source code you changed.

If you can't do this for some reason, check out the latest fbmuck source
code from sourceforge.net and diff against that.
