 * Revision 1.16  2005/08/18 15:46:11  wog
 * Fix bug introduced in r1.15 by which all non-wizards controlled everything (!)
 * if GOD_PRIV was defined.
 *
 * Revision 1.15  2005/07/14 12:16:23  winged
 * Adding a bunch of GOD_PRIV God's objects can't be screwed with code
 *
 * Revision 1.14  2005/07/04 12:04:24  winged
 * Initial revisions for everything.
 *
 * Revision 1.13  2005/06/27 19:30:35  winged
 * Prevent wizards from setting themselves \!W with GOD_PRIV undefined, to prevent a case where there are no wizards at all
 *
 * Revision 1.12  2005/06/21 17:25:57  winged
 * GOD_PRIV now allows God and God's things to set other wizards QUELL.
 * Documented a LOT of things herein.
 * Simplified OkObj().
 *
 * Revision 1.11  2004/01/14 16:57:11  wolfwings
 * Further cleanup of #defines across codebase.
 * Replaced numerous #defines relating to Pennies with SETVALUE/GETVALUE.
 * Removed replaced #defines from db.h.
 * Simplified processing of prim_movepennies to support newly-extended penny-prop system.
 * Replaced SETVALUE with LOADVALUE in db.c database-loading functions.
 * Moved ANTILOCK to OBSOLETE_ANTILOCK, limited processing to pre-Foxen8 databases.
 *
 * Revision 1.10  2004/01/12 09:42:49  wolfwings
 * Removed remaining Anonymity code.
 *
 * Revision 1.9  2003/11/04 19:26:19  revar
 * Fixed a number of off-by-one crasher bugs, due to bad comparisons with db_top.
 *
 * Revision 1.8  2003/10/07 07:24:28  revar
 * Fixed possible crasher bug with autostart programs.
 *
 * Revision 1.7  2002/09/08 23:07:19  sombre
 * Fixed memory leak when toading online players.
 * Fixed remove_prop bug so it will remove props ending in /. (bug #537744)
 * Fixed potential buffer overrun with the CHECKRETURN and ABORT_MPI macros.
 * Fixed @omessage bug where player names would not be prefixed on additional
 *   newlines. (bug #562370)
 * Added IGNORING? ( d1 d2 -- i ) returns true if d1 is ignoring d2.
 * Added IGNORE_ADD ( d1 d2 -- ) adds d2 to d1's ignore list.
 * Added IGNORE_DEL ( d1 d2 -- ) removes d2 from d1's ignore list.
 * Added ARRAY_GET_IGNORELIST ( d -- a ) returns an array of d's ignores.
 * Added support for ignoring (gagging) players, ignores are mutual in that if
 *   player A ignores player B, A will not hear B, and B will not hear A.
 * Added ignore_prop @tune to specify the directory the ignore list is held under,
 *   if set blank ignore support is disabled, defaults to "@ignore/def".
 * Added max_ml4_preempt_count @tune to specify the maximum number of instructions
 *   an mlevel4 (wizbitted) program may run before it is aborted, if set to 0
 *   no limit is imposed.  Defaults to 0.
 * Added reserved_names @tune which when set to a smatch pattern will refuse any
 *   object creations or renames which match said pattern.  Defaults to "".
 * Added reserved_player_names @tune which when set to a smatch pattern will refuse
 *   any player creations or renames which match said pattern.  Defaults to "".
