COMMENTS
Comments:
  Only 26 levels of recursion are allowed, so funcs that deep return literally.
In loops, a max of 256 iterations are allowed before they exit automatically.
Lists have a maximum size of 256 lines, or 4096 characters, whichever is less.
  
  All matching will be done relative to the trigger object first, then relative
to the triggering player, if nothing was matched in the first pass.
  
  The 'me' and 'here' keywords always are relative to the triggering player.
The trigger object is referred to by 'this'.
~

DEFINITIONS
Definitions:
    A Trigger object is the object that the MPI script is evaluated from.
  
    A List is a string containing several individual substring items,
seperated by carriage return characters.
  
    A property based list is a set of consecutively numbered properties that
each contain one string in a list of strings.  Property based lists
are often numbered like: listname1, listname2, listname3, listname4, &c.
Another popular format is listname#/1, listname#/2, listname#/3, etc.
MPI can read in either of those formats, and several more, for that
matter.
  
    For logical constructs, a string value of "0", or a null string ("") are
both considered false.  Any other value is considered true.

~----------------------------------------------------------------------------
~
~
TZOFFSET
{tzoffset}
    Returns local time zone offset from GMT in seconds.
~
~
TIME
{time}
{time:timezone}
    Returns a time string in the 24hr form hh:mm:ss.  If the timezone
argument is given, then it offsets the time returned by that number
of hours.
~
~
DATE
{date}
{date:timezone}
    Returns a date string in the form mm/dd/yy.  If the timezone
argument is given, then it offsets the date returned by that number
of seconds.
~
~
FTIME
{ftime:format}
{ftime:format,tz}
{ftime:format,tz,secs}
    Returns a time string in the format you specify.  See 'man timefmt' for
the %subs that you can use in the format string.  If specified, tz is the
number of seconds offset from GMT.  If specified, secs is the systime to
use, instead of the current time.  {ftime:%x %X %Y,{tzoffset},0} will return
the date and time for systime 0, for the local time zone of the server.
~
~
TIMESTR
{timestr:secs}
    Given a time period in seconds, this will return a concise abbreviated
string representation of how long that time was.  This might return a value
like "9d 12:56" for 9 days, 12 hours, and 56 minutes.
~
~
LTIMESTR
{ltimestr:secs}
    Given a time period, in seconds, this will return a string, including a
breakdown of all the time units of that period.  For example, given a number
of seconds, it might return:
        3 years, 10 months, 4 weeks, 1 day, 18 hours, 40 mins, 21 secs
~
~
STIMESTR
{stimestr:secs}
    Given a time period, in seconds, this will return the most significant
time unit of that time period.  For example, a number of seconds, that is
equivalent to 9 days, 23 hours, 10 minutes, and 52 seconds, will be have
the value "9d" returned, as the abbreviated most significant time unit.
~
~
SECS
{secs}
    Returns system time: the number of second since midnight 1/1/70 GMT
~
~
CONVTIME
{convtime:string}
    Converts "HH:MM:SS Mo/Dy/Yr" format time string to systime seconds.
~
~
CONVSECS
{convsecs:systime}
    Converts systime seconds into a readable time string.
~
~
DELAY
{delay:secs,expr}
    Evaluates the given expression, then puts the result of that on the
timequeue, to execute after the given number of seconds.  At that time,
the string is evaluated again, and displayed to the user, or to the room,
depending on whether it was run from a regular message such as @succ, or
from an omessage such as @osucc.  Since the expression is evaluated both
before and after being delayed, you need to put MPI code that is to run
after the delay within a {lit:expr} command.  If a {delay} evaluation is
a null string, then the notify or notify_except will not be done.  {delay}
will return the process ID of the event it puts on the timequeue.
~
~
KILL
{kill:0}
{kill:processID}
    Kills a process on the timequeue, that was possibly created by {DELAY}.
If the process ID it is given is 0, then it will kill all processes done by
that trigger object.  If the process to be killed was not set off by that
trigger, and was not set off by any object that the owner of the trigger
owns, then this will error out with Permission denied.  If no process is
found, this returns 0.  If a process was found, and the permissions were
okay, then the process is killed, and {kill} returns the number of processes
killed.  Usually 1.

IF
{if:check,true}
{if:check,true,false}
    This is a simple conditional command.  It evaluates the 'check'
argument and if it is true, then it evaluates the 'true' argument and
returns it's result.  If 'check' does not evaluate as true, then it will
evaluate the 'false' argument, if there is one, and returns it's result.
If there is no false argument, and 'check' evaluated false, then it
returns a null string.  Example:
    Your computer is {if:{eq:2,3},broken!,all right.}
Also see: not, and, or, xor, eq, ne, lt, gt, le, le, default and dbeq
~
~
DEFAULT
{default:value1,value2}
    Returns value2 if value1 is null or 0, otherwise returns value1.  Example:
    You entered {default:{&arg},nothing}.
~
~
EQ|EQUALS|==
{eq:expr1,expr2}
    If expr1 and expr2 evaluate out to the same value, then this returns
true.  Otherwise, this returns false.  If both expressions evaluate out
to numbers, then this compares them numerically.
~
~
NE|NOTEQUALS|!=|<>
{ne:expr1,expr2}
    If expr1 and expr2 evaluate out to the same value, then this returns
false.  Otherwise, this returns true.  If both expressions evaluate out
to numbers, then this compares them numerically.
~
~
GT|GREATERTHAN|>
{gt:expr1,expr2}
    Evaluates expr1 and expr2, then returns true if expr1 was larger.
~
~
GE|>=
{ge:expr1,expr2}
    Evals expr1 and expr2, then returns true if expr1 was larger or equal.
~
~
LT|LESSTHAN|<
{lt:expr1,expr2}
    Evaluates expr1 and expr2, then returns true if expr1 was smaller.
~
~
LE|<=
{le:expr1,expr2}
    Evals expr1 and expr2, then returns true if expr1 was smaller or equal.
~
~
NOT|!
{not:expr}
    Returns the logical NOT of expr.  If expr was true, this returns false.
If expr was false, this returns true.
~
~
OR
{or:expr1,expr2...}
    Returns true if expr1 or expr2 evaluate as true.  Otherwise, this
returns false.  If expr1 was true, this doesn't bother to exaluate expr2,
as it does C-style shortcutting.  If there are more than two arguments,
then this will evaluate them until either one returns true, or until it
has evaluated all the expressions.  This returns false only if all of the
expressions return false.
~
~
AND|&&
{and:expr1,expr2...}
    Returns true if expr1 and expr2 evaluate as true.  Otherwise, this
returns false.  If expr1 was false, this doesn't bother to evaluate
expr2, as it does C-style shortcutting.  If there are more than two
arguments, then this will evaluate all of them until either one returns
false, in which case this function returns false, or until it has evaluated
all of the arguments.  This function returns true only if all the arguments
evaluate as true.
~
~
XOR|EXCLUSIVEOR
{xor:expr1,expr2}
    Returns true if expr1 or expr2 evaluate as true, but false if both do.
Otherwise, this returns false.

PROP
{prop:propname}
{prop:propname,obj}
    Returns the literal string value of the given property.  If no object
parameter is passed to it, it looks for the property somewhere down the
environment from the trigger object.  Otherwise, it looks down the
environment from the object specified.  If the property is not found,
this returns an empty string.  If the property that it tries to access is
read restricted and the owner of the trigger object does not own the
object that the property is found on, then the MPI script stops with a
Permission denied error.
~
~
PROP!
{prop!:propname}
{prop!:propname,obj}
    Returns the literal string value of the given property.  If no object
parameter is passed to it, it looks for the property on the trigger.
Otherwise, it looks for the property on the object specified.  If the
property is not found, this returns an empty string.  If the property that
it tries to access is read restricted and the owner of the trigger object
does not own the object that the property is found on, then the MPI
script stops with a Permission denied error.
~
~
EXEC
{exec:propname}
{exec:propname,obj}
    Returns the string value of the given property, after having
evaluated any embedded MPI commands that it contained.  If no object
parameter is passed to it, it looks for the property somewhere down the
environment from the trigger object.  Otherwise, it looks down the
environment from the object specified.  If the property is not found,
this returns an empty string.  If the property that it tries to access is
read restricted and the owner of the trigger object does not own the
object that the property is found on, then the MPI script stops with a
Permission denied error.
~
~
EXEC!
{exec!:propname}
{exec!:propname,obj}
    Returns the string value of the given property, after having
evaluated any embedded MPI commands that it contained.  If no object
parameter is passed to it, it looks for the property on the trigger.
Otherwise, it looks for the property on the object specified.  If the
property is not found, this returns an empty string.  If the property
that it tries to access is read restricted and the owner of the trigger
object does not own the object that the property is found on, then
the MPI script stops with a Permission denied error.
~
~
INDEX|{INDEX
{index:propname}
{index:propname,obj}
    Returns the string value of the property whose name is stored in the
given property.  This sounds confusing, but it's basically just the same
as {exec:{prop:propname}}.  If no object parameter is passed to it, it
looks for both the index property and the referenced property somewhere
down the environment from the trigger object.  Otherwise, it looks down
the environment from the object specified for both of them.  If either
property is not found, this returns an empty string.  If the property
that it tries to access is read restricted, and the owner of the trigger
object does not own the object that the properties are found on, then
the MPI script stops with a Permission denied error.  Any MPI code in
the target property is evaluated and the result is returned.
~
~
INDEX!
{index!:propname}
{index!:propname,obj}
    Returns the string value of the property whose name is stored in the
given property.  This sounds confusing, but it's basically just the same
as {exec!:{prop!:propname}}.  If no object parameter is passed to it, it
looks for both the index property and the referenced property on the trigger
object.  Otherwise, it looks on the specified object for both of them.
If either property is not found, this returns an empty string.  If the
property that it tries to access is read restricted, and the owner of the
trigger object does not own the object that the properties are found on,
then the MPI script stops with a Permission denied error.  Any MPI code in
the target property is evaluated and the result is returned.
~
~
STORE
{store:val,prop}
{store:val,prop,obj}
    Stores a string value in a given property.  If no obj parameter is
given, then it stores the property on the trigger object.  Otherwise, it
will store it on the given object.  If you specify a propname that is
protected, you will get a Permission Denied error.  You are only allowed
to store properties on objects controlled by the owner of the trigger
object.  The trigger object is the object that triggered the evaluation of
the MPI commands.  This function returns the string that is stored as the
prop value.  If you store a null value in the property, then it will remove
the property if it is not a propdir.  It will clear the value of the prop
if it IS a propdir.
~
~
DELPROP
{delprop:propname}
{delprop:propname,object}
    This function will remove a property and all of it's subsidiary properties
in the case that it is a propdir.  This will delete the property on the
trigger object, unless an object argument is specified.  If one is, then it
will delete the property on that given object.  This function returns a null
string.  If you specify a propname that is protected, you will get an error
of Permission Denied.  You are only allowed to delete properties from objects
that are owned by the owner of the trigger object.
~
~
BLESS
{bless:propname}
{bless:propname,object}
    Blesses a property so that MPI executed from it will run with blessed
permissions.  This command itself requires blessed permissions to run.
~
~
UNBLESS
{unbless:propname}
{unbless:propname,object}
    Removes the blessing of a property so that MPI executed from it will no
longer run with blessed permissions.  This command itself requires blessed
permissions to run.
~
~
LIST
{list:listname}
{list:listname,obj}
    Returns a string, containing a carriage-return delimited list of
individual lines from a property based list.  A property based list is a
series of properties that are consecutively numbered.  The server
understands several different formats, and can also read in property
lists in either the propnameX format, or the propname#/X format.  It does
NOT evaluate the contents of the list for embedded MPI commands.  If no
obj argument is supplied, then it looks for the list somewhere down the
environment from the trigger object.  Otherwise, it looks for the list
down the environment from the given object.
~
~
CONCAT
{concat:listname}
{concat:listname,obj}
    Returns a string, containing the concatenated lines of a property
based list.  It concatenates the list semi-intelligently, putting a
single space between lines normally, and two spaces between lines when
the previous one ended with a period, exclamation mark, or question mark.
A property based list is a series of properties that are consecutively
numbered.  The server understands several different formats, and can also
read in property lists in either the propnameX format, or the propname#/X
format.  It does NOT evaluate the contents of the list for embedded MPI
commands.  If no obj argument is supplied, then it looks for the list
somewhere down the environment from the trigger object.  Otherwise, it
looks for the list down the environment from the given object.
~
~
LEXEC
{lexec:listname}
{lexec:listname,obj}
    This takes a property based list, and concatenates all its lines
together, stripping spaces from the beginning and end of each one.  It
then evaluates the result for MPI commands, and returns the resulting
string.  A property based list is a series of properties that are
consecutively numbered.  The server understands several different
formats, and can also read in property lists in either the propnameX
format, or the propname#/X format.  If no obj argument is supplied, then
it looks for the list somewhere down the environment from the trigger
object.  Otherwise, it looks for the list down the environment from the
given object.
~
~
RAND
{rand:listname}
{rand:listname,obj}
    Returns the value of a randomly picked list item from a property
based list.  If no obj parameter is given, then it looks down the
environment from the trigger object for the list.  Otherwise, it looks
down the environment from the given object.  Any MPI code in the target
property is evaluated and the result is returned.
~
~
SELECT
{select:value,listname}
{select:value,listname,object}
    Returns the value of a single list item from a sparse property list.
The item chosen is the one who's line number is the largest one that is
less than or equal to the given value.  If the list is missing any items,
then {select} will return the item in the list with the highest line number
that is less than or equal to the given value.  ie:  If the list has the
following entries:
    _junk#/1:one
    _junk#/5:two
    _junk#/16:three
    _junk#/20:four
Then {select:9,_junk} will return "two", {select:16,_junk} will return
"three", and {select:25,_junk} will return "four".
~
~
TIMESUB
{timesub:period,offset,listname}
{timesub:period,offset,listname,object}
    This is sort of like {list}, except that it will only return one line
of the given named property list.  The line it chooses depends on the
time.  Any MPI code in the target line is evaluated and the result is
returned.  The period is the length of time, in seconds, that it takes for
{timesub} to cycle through the entire list.  The offset is the number of
seconds to offset into the time period, if you actually need to synchronize
the {timesub} with something.  The offset usually is just left at zero.
If the object argument is not passed, it looks for the list on the trigger.
What this all means, is that if you have, for example, a period of 3600
(one hour), an offset of zero, and a property list that has six items in
it, then {timesub} will return the first line of the property list during
the first ten minutes of the hour, the second line during the next ten
minutes, and so on, until it returns the last line during the last ten
minutes of the hour.  Then it returns the first line for the beginning
of the next hour.  Here's an example:
    {timesub:86400,0,_sunmoon}
This example will show different property list lines, depending on the
time of day.  The period is 86400 seconds, which is one day.  If the
property list has 24 items in it, then a different line will be returned
for each hour of the day.
~
~
PROPDIR
{propdir:propname}
{propdir:propname,object}
    Returns true if the given property is a propdir, containing sub-props.
Otherwise, this returns false.  If no object parameter is passed to it, it
looks for the property on the trigger object.  Otherwise, it looks on the
object specified.  If the property is not found, this returns false.
~
~
LISTPROPS
{listprops:propdir}
{listprops:propdir,object}
{listprops:propdir,object,pattern}
    This function will return a list that contains the full names of all the
sub-properties contained by the given propdir.  If not given, object defaults
to the trigger object.  If a pattern is given, the sub-properties in the
propdir are each compared against the smatch wildcard pattern, and only those
that match are returned in the list.  This comparison is only done on the last
part of the property name after the last /.

Also see: propdir and smatch

~String functions generally don't strip spaces in their arguments.
~
~
NL|\r
{nl}  or  \r
    Returns a carriage return character.  This can be used to seperate
items in a list, or can split the string at that point, starting a new line.
Example:  the string:
    This is\ran example{nl}of using newlines.
would print out like:
    This is
    an example
    of using newlines.
~
~
SUBST
{subst:str,old,new}
    Returns a copy of 'str' with all substring instances of 'old' replaced
by the text specified by 'new'.  Basically just substitutes the new text
for the old text in str.  example: {subst:Hello World!,l,r} would return
"Herro Worrd!"
~
~
STRLEN
{strlen:string}
    Returns an integer that is the number of character in string.
~
~
SMATCH
{smatch:str,pattern}
    Matches 'str' against the wildcard pattern.  If there is a match,
this returns true, or "1".  If it doesn't match, this returns a value
of "0", or false.  In wildcard patterns, the following characters have
the following meanings:
    *               matches any number of any character.
    ?               matches one character, of any type.
    [abcde]         matches one char, if it is a, b, c, d, or e.
    [a-z]           matches one char, if it is between a and z, inclusive.
    [^abd-z]        matches one char is it is NOT a, b, or between d and z.
    {word1|word2}   matches one word, if it is word1, or word2.
    {^word1|word2}  matches one word, if it is NOT word1 or word2.
    \               escapes any of the prev chars, making it not special.
~
~
STRIP
{strip:string}
    Returns a copy of string with all the spaces stripped from the beginning
and the end.
~
~
TOLOWER
{tolower:string}
    Returns a copy of string, with all uppercase chars converted to lowercase.
~
~
TOUPPER
{toupper:string}
    Returns a copy of string, with all lowercase chars converted to uppercase.
~
~
RIGHT
{right:string}
{right:string,fieldwidth}
{right:string,fieldwidth,padstring}
    Takes a string and pads it to fit the given fieldwidth, with the string
right justified.  If no padstring is given, it assumes that it will pad the
string with spaces.  If no fieldwidth is given, it assumes that the field
width is 78 characters.  Example:
    {right:Hello,10,_.}
would return the string "_._._Hello"
~
~
LEFT
{left:string}
{left:string,fieldwidth}
{left:string,fieldwidth,padstring}
    Takes a string and pads it to fit the given fieldwidth, with the string
left justified.  If no padstring is given, it assumes that it will pad the
string with spaces.  If no fieldwidth is given, it assumes that the field
width is 78 characters.  Example:
    {left:Hello,10,_.}
would return the string "Hello_._._"
~
~
CENTER
{center:string}
{center:string,fieldwidth}
{center:string,fieldwidth,padstring}
    Takes a string and pads it to fit the given fieldwidth, with the string
center justified.  If no padstring is given, it assumes that it will pad the
string with spaces.  If no fieldwidth is given, it assumes that the field
width is 78 characters.  Example:
    {center:Hello,10,1234567890}
would return the string "123Hello12"
~
~
INSTR
{instr:str1,str2}
    Lists the position of the first substring within str1 that matches str2.
If no such substring exists, then this returns a 0.
~
~
MIDSTR
{midstr:str,pos}
{midstr:str,pos1,pos2}
    Returns the substring that starts at pos1 within str.  If no pos2 is
given, then the returned string is only the character at the given pos1
position.  if a pos2 position is given, then it returns the substring
beginning at pos1 and ending at pos2, inclusive.  If pos1 or pos2 are
negative, then they represent the position that is that absolute number
of characters from the end of the string.  The first character in str is
1, and the last one can always be referenced by -1.  If a position would
be before the beginning of the string, it is assumed to be at the
beginning of the string.  If it would be beyond the end of the string, it
is assumed to be at the last character. If the starting position is later
in the string than the ending position, then the returned string has the
characters in reverse order.  If either pos1 or pos2 are 0, then this
returns a null string.  ("")
~
~
LIT|LITERAL
{lit:string}
    Returns the literal string given as its parameter.  This means you can
have things that look like MPI commands within it, and it will not evaluate
them, but will rather just treat them as a string.
~
~
EVAL
{eval:string}
    Sort of the exact opposite of {lit:}.  This takes a string, and
evaluates it for MPI commands embedded within it.  This can be used on
the output of {list:}, for example.  The evaluated mpi commands will
be run unblessed.

Also see: eval!
~
~
EVAL!
{eval!:string}
    Sort of the exact opposite of {lit:}.  This takes a string, and
evaluates it for MPI commands embedded within it.  This can be used on
the output of {list:}, for example.  Unlike the {eval} command, the
evaluated mpi commands will be run with the same blessings as the code
that executed the {eval!}.
Also see: eval and revoke
~
~
REVOKE
{revoke:commands}
    Executes the enclosed commands with all blessing permissions revoked.
This is good to wrap around {eval} statements that may execute user
supplied code, to prevent security holes.
~
~
NULL
{null:expr...}
    Returns a null string, no matter what the expressions within it return.
This can take up to nine arguments, though you could pass the output of
several commands as one argument.
~
~
PRONOUNS
{pronouns:string}
{pronouns:string,object}
    If passed one argument, evaluates the string and does pronoun substitution
with regards to the using player.  If given two args, it does the pronoun
substitution with regards to the given object.
~
~
TELL
{tell:string}
{tell:string,player}
    If passed only a string, tells the user that string.  If passed both
a string, and a player dbref, it will tell the given player the message.
This returns the message that was sent.  If the trigger isn't a room, or
an exit on a room, and if the message doesn't already begin with the
user's name, then the user's name will be prepended to the message.  The
two exceptions to this are that if the messages is being sent to the
owner of the trigger, or to the user, then the user's name will not be
prepended.
~
~
OTELL
{otell:string}
{otell:string,room}
{otell:string,room,player}
    This will tell the given string to all the players in the room, except
for the given player.  If no room argument is given, it is assumed to be
the room that the triggering player is in.  If no player is given, then it
assumes that you want to skip sending the message to the triggering player.
If you pass it a player of #-1, it will send the message to all the players
in the room.  This returns the message that was sent.  If the trigger isn't
a room, or an exit on a room, and if the message doesn't already begin with
the user's name, then the user's name will be prepended to the message.
~
~
ATTR
{attr:attribute,string}
{attr:attribute,attribute,string}
{attr:attribute,...,attribute,string}
    This will surround the given string with the neccesary ANSI escape codes
to cause the text to display with the given attributes.  You may specify up
to eight attributes, though this shouldn't ever be neccesary.  The supported
attributes are: null, reset, bold, dim, flash, underline, reverse, black,
red, yellow, green, cyan, blue, magenta, white, bg_black, bg_red, bg_yellow, 
bg_green, bg_cyan, bg_blue, bg_magenta, and bg_white.
    Not all clients will display all these attributes, and those that do 
won't always show them the same way.  Players who do not have their Color 
flag set will not see the ANSI codes or colors at all.  Nesting {attr}
commands probably just won't work.

~----------------------------------------------------------------------------
~
~
~All math functions deal with integer numbers.
~
INC|INCREMENT
{inc:var}
{inc:var,val}
    Increments the value of the given variable by one, returning the result.
If a value argument is given, then it will add that value to the variable,
instead of the value 1.
~
~
DEC|DECREMENT
{dec:var}
{dec:var,val}
    Decrements the value of the given variable by one, returning the result.
If a value argument is given, then it will subtract that from the variable,
instead of the value 1.
~
~
ADD|ADDITION
{add:expr1,expr2}
{add:expr1,expr2,expr3...}
    Returns the sum of the values of expr1 and expr2.  If more than two args
are given, then this will add all the args together and return the result.
~
~
SUBT|SUBTRACTION
{subt:expr1,expr2}
{subt:expr1,expr2,expr3...}
    Returns the difference of the values expr1 and expr2.  If more than two
args are given, all values are subtracted from the first value in sequence.
For example: {subt:10,3,2,4} would be read as 10 - 3 - 2 - 4, and it would
return a result of 1.
~
~
MULT|MULTIPLY
{mult:expr1,expr2}
{mult:expr1,expr2,expr3...}
    Returns the product of the values expr1 and expr2.  If more than two args
are given, then they are all multiplied together to get the result.
~
~
DIV|DIVIDE
{div:expr1,expr2}
{div:expr1,expr2,expr3...}
    Returns the value of expr1 divided by expr2.  Division by zero will
return zero.  If more than two arguments are given, then the first argument
is divided by the second, and the result is divided by the third, etc, for
all of the arguments.  For example:  {div:180,6,3,5} would be read like
180 / 6 / 3 / 5, and a result of 2 would be returned.
~
~
MOD|MODULO
{mod:expr1,expr2}
    Returns the leftover remainder of expr1 divided by expr2.  If more than
two arguments are given, then the first arguments is modded by the second,
then the result of that would be modded by the third, and so on and so forth.
For example: {mod:91,20,3} would be read as 91 % 20 % 3, and a result of 2
would be returned.
~
~
DICE
{dice:X}
{dice:X,Y}
{dice:X,Y,Z}
    Given one parameter, picks a random number between 1 and X. (1dX)
Given two parameters, it randomly generates Y numbers between 1 and X,
and adds them together. (YdX) A third parameter, if given, is just added
to this sum as a modifier. (YdX+Z)
~
~
MIN|MINIMUM
{min:expr1,expr2}
    Returns the lesser of the values of expr1 and expr2.
~
~
MAX|MAXIMUM
{max:expr1,expr2}
    Returns the greater of the values of expr1 and expr2.
~
~
ABS|ABSOLUTE
{abs:expr}
    Returns the absolute value of expr.
~
~
SIGN
{sign:expr}
    Returns -1 if expr is negative.  Returns 1 if expr is positive.
If expr is 0, then it returns 0.
~
~
DIST|DISTANCE
{dist:x,y}              Returns distance from 0,0 that x,y is.
{dist:x,y,z}            Returns distance from 0,0,0 that x,y,z is.
{dist:x,y,x2,y2}        Returns distance between x,y and x2,y2.
{dist:x,y,z,x2,y2,z2}   Returns distance between x,y,z and x2,y2,z2.
    Given two arguments, this calculates the distance of a 2D point from
the origin.  Given three arguments, this calculates the distance of a 3D
point from the origin.  Given four arguments, this calculates the distance
between a pair of 2D points.  Given six arguments, this calculates the
distance between a pair of 3D points.

~----------------------------------------------------------------------------
~
~
FOR
{for:varname,start,end,increment,command}
    Acts as a counting loop, like BASIC's for loops.  The varname is the name
of the variable that it will create and use to store the count value.  The
start value will be the initial value of the variable, and the end value will
be the value that the variable is working towards.  The increment is how much
the variable will be incremented by in each loop.  The command will be eval-
uated for each value of the variable between the beginning and ending values.
For example:
    {null:{for:i,10,1,-1,{tell:{&i}}}}
will echo a countdown from ten to one, inclusive, to the user.
~
~
WHILE
{while:check,expr}
    This is a looping structure.  It evaluates the 'check' argument, and
if it evaluates true, then it evaluates the expr argument, and repeats
the process.  If 'check' evaluates false, then the loop is exited.
This returns the result of the last evaluation of expr.
~
~
FOREACH
{foreach:var,list,expr}
{foreach:var,list,expr,sep}
    This evaluates expr for each and every item in the given list.  On
each evaluation, the temporary variable var will contain the value of the
item under scrutiny.  var will only be defined for the duration of expr,
and will be undefined after the {foreach} construct finishes.  If sep is
given, then it uses that string as the item seperator in list, instead of
the usual carriage return character.  sep can be multiple characters
long.  This structure returns the result of the last evaluation of expr.
Example:
    {foreach:thing,{contents:here},{tell:{name:{&thing}}}}
This will display the name of every object in the room, then it will return
the name of the last object it displayed.
~
~
FILTER
{filter:var,list,expr}
{filter:var,list,exp,sep}
{filter:var,lst,exp,sep,s2}
    This evaluates expr for each and every item in the given list.  On
each evaluation, the temporary variable var will contain the value of the
item under scrutiny.  This function returns a list containing all of the
items from the input list, for which expr evaluated true.  var will only
be defined for the duration of expr, and will be undefined after the
{filter} construct finishes.  If sep is given, then it uses that string
as the item seperator in the input list, instead of the usual carriage
return character.  If s2 is defined, then it will use that string to
seperate the items in the list it returns, instead of the normal carriage
return.  sep and s2 can be multiple characters long.
~
~
PARSE
{parse:var,list,expr}
{parse:var,list,expr,sep}
{parse:var,list,expr,sep,s2}
    This evaluates expr for each and every item in the given list.  On
each evaluation, the temporary variable var will contain the value of the
item under scrutiny.  This function returns a list containing the output
of expr for each item within the list.  This lets you do direct translat-
ion of a list of dbrefs, for example, into a list of names.  var will
only be defined for the duration of expr, and will be undefined after the
{filter} construct finishes.  If sep is given, then it uses that string
as the item seperator in the input list, instead of the usual carriage
return character.  If s2 is defined, then it will use that string to
seperate the items in the list it returns, instead of the normal carriage
return.  sep and s2 can be multiple characters long.
~
~
FOLD
{fold:var1,var2,list,expr}
{fold:var1,var2,lst,expr,sep}
    This takes a list and stores the first two items in var1 and var2, then
evaluates expr.  The value returned by expr is then put in var1, and the next
list item is put in var2.  Expr keeps being evaluated in this way until there
are no more list items left.  This returns the last value returned by expr.
If a sep argument is given, the input list is assumed to have its individual
items delimited by that string, otherwise it assumes a carriage return.

this returns false.  ("0")  Wizards control everything.
~
~
NEARBY
{nearby:obj}
{nearby:obj,obj2}
    If one argument is given, then this returns true ("1") if the given
object is nearby to the trigger object.  If two arguments are given, then
it returns true if the two objects are nearby one another.  Otherwise,
this returns false. ("0")  Nearby is defined as: 1) The two objects are
in the same location, or 2) One object contains the other, or 3) the two
objects are in fact the same object.

Bad, Room, Exit, Thing, Player, and Program.
~
~
CONTENTS
{contents:obj}
{contents:obj,type}
    Returns a list of the contents of the given object.  If a second
argument is passed to it, it restricts the listing to only those objects
that are of the given type.  Either the object must be nearby the trigger
object, or else the owner of the trigger object must control the object.
Otherwise this will error out with a Permission Denied error.  The valid
object type values are Room, Thing, Exit, Player, Program, and Bad.
HINT:  If you need to get a list of two types of objects from the room,
just concatenate the lists from two calls to this function, with each
object type you want.  ie:
    {mklist:{contents:here,player},{contents:here,thing}}    or
    {contents:here,player}{nl}{contents:here,thing}
~
~
EXITS
{exits:obj}

Permission Denied.  Programs and exits never have exits attached to them.
~
~
LINKS
{links:obj}
    Returns the object reference of what the given object if linked to.
Since exits can be meta-links, linked to multiple exits, if there is more
than one link, then this function returns a list of all the destinations,
seperated by carriage return characters.  (\r)
~
~
FORCE
{force:object,command}
    Forces the given player or thing to do the given command.  The thing
forced must be @flock'ed to the trigger object, or the trigger object's

name matching, so {dbeq:*Wizard,#1} will return true if #1 is named Wizard.
~
~
LOCKED
{locked:player,obj}
    Tests the _/lok (@lock) standard lock property on obj against the given
player.  Returns true if the lock is locked against the player.
~
~
TESTLOCK
{testlock:obj,prop}
{testlock:obj,prop,who}
{testlock:obj,prop,who,def}
    Tests the lock property 'prop', on 'obj' against the given player 'who'.
If no 'who' argument is given, then it checks the lock against the using
player.  If a def argument is given, then the lock will default to that
value, if there is no lock property of the given name on the given object.
Returns true if the lock is locked against the player.
~
~
HOLDS

{holds:obj1,obj2}
    Returns true if the location of obj1 is obj2.  If no obj2 argument is
given, then this will return true if the location of obj1 is the player.
~
~
CONTAINS
{contains:obj1}
{contains:obj1,obj2}
    Returns true if obj1 is within obj2, or within anything it contains, or
within anything they contain.  If obj2 is not given, then it checks to see

AWAKE
{awake:player}
    Returns how many times player is connected.  This means that it will
returns 0 if the player is not connected.  If the given object is NOT a
player, it will return 0.  If the given player is NOT local to the trigger,
and is not the owner of the trigger, and this is not run with blessed perms,
then this will return 0.  In all other cases, it will return a positive
number, being how many times the given player is connected to the server.

Variable Handling Functions|Variable|Variables|Vars|Var|VarFuncs
Variable Handling Functions

&arg  &cmd  &how  set   v     with  

~----------------------------------------------------------------------------
~
~
V|&|VARIABLE
{&VAR}
{v:VAR}
    These are two ways of trying to do the same thing.  They return the
value of the named variable VAR.  If there is no variable with the given
name currently defined, then this gives an error stating as much.  Variables
can be defined either with the {with:} function or within a looping command.
~
~
~There are three standard variables that every MPI program can read:
~
&HOW|HOW
{&how}  
    The {&how} variable is a short string telling what ran the MPI command.
It can have the values "(@desc)", "(@succ)", "(@osucc)", etc. for when it
is run from an @desc, an @succ, an @osucc, or whatever.  It can also have
the value "(@lock)" for when it is run from a lock test.
~
~
&CMD|CMD
{&cmd}
    The {&cmd} variable contains the command name the user used, that
caused the MPI to run.  This is generally the exit name that the player
triggered.  For example, if the player typed 'east', and triggered the exit
named 'east;e;out', which ran some MPI commands, the {&cmd} variable would
have a value of "east".
~
~
&ARG|ARG
{&arg}
    The {&arg} variable contains a string with the value of the command
line arguments the user entered.  This is so that you can have stuff like
MPI in the fail of an exit, and when the user triggers the exit, and has
some extra text on the line they entered, other than the exitname, the
MPI can take that extra stuff as arguments for use.  Note that you need
to set an action HAVEN to get it to accept command line arguments.
~
~
~Other MPI functions used to work with variables are:
~
SET
{set:var,value}
    This sets the value of the given named variable to the given value.
If no variable with that given name is currently defined, then this gives
an error message complaining about that.
~
~
WITH
{with:var,val,expr..}
    This defines a new variable with the given name, and sets it's value
to the given val.  Up to 7 expr's are allowed, but the only value
returned to {with}'s caller, is the value returned by the evaluation of
the last expr.  If there is already a variable of the same name, then
this command will override that variable, for the duration of the {with:}
command.  The new variable is only valid to use within the confines of
the {with:} command, and it will go away after the command completes.
This provides scoped variables quite effectively.  NOTE:  There can be no
more than 32 variables defined at any one time, total.  This includes
variables that are defined within macros, or properties or lists that are
executed with {exec:} or {lexec:}.   Here's an example to illustrate the
scope of variables inside of {with:} commands:

    {prop:_mydesc}                           <- {&people} not defined.
    {with:people,{contents:here,players},    <- Defining.  Not available yet.
        {if:{count:{&people}},               <- It's usable now.
            The players awake here are

~----------------------------------------------------------------------------
~

COUNT
{count:list}
{count:list,sep}
    This counts the number of \r delimited items that are in the given list.
This is effectively a list item count.  If the sep argument if given, then
it counts the number of sep delimited substrings in list.  ie: The default
sep is \r. (A carriage return.)
~
~
MKLIST
{mklist:value...}       Returns a list with all given values.
    This returns a list with all the given values as list items, seperated
by carriage returns.  ('\r's) Example:
    {mklist:Tom,Dick,Harry}
returns "Tom\rDick\rHarry".  Note:  A maximum of nine items can be passed to
the {mklist} function.  If you need more, you can chain {mklist}s together.
Example:
    {mklist:{mklist:a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i},j,k,l,m,n,o,p}
~
~
SUBLIST
{sublist:list,pos1}
{sublist:list,pos1,pos2}
{sublist:list,pos1,pos2,sep}
    Takes a list, and returns a subset of the list items within it.  The
subset is all the list items between list item pos1, and list item pos2,
inclusive.  If the pos2 argument is omitted, it assumes that pos2 is the
same as pos1.  If pos2 is less than pos1, then all the list items between
pos2 and pos1 are returned, in reversed order.  If pos1 or pos2 are negative,
it counts that many list items back from the end of the list, so -1 is the
last list item, and -5 would be the fifth from last list item.  The input
list is assumed to be delimited by carriage returns (\r) unless the sep
argument is given.
~
~
LRAND
{lrand:list}
{lrand:list,seperator}
    Returns a randomly picked stringlist item from the given list.  If the
seperator argument is given, then it will assume that the stringlist has it's
items delimited by the given seperator string, instead of by carriage returns.
~
~
LUNIQUE
{lunique:list}
    Returns list with all duplicate items removed.
~
~
LUNION
{lunion:list1,list2}
    Combines the contents of list1 and list2, removing any duplicates.
~
~
LCOMMON
{lcommon:list1,list2}
    Creates a list containing every item that appears in BOTH list1 and
list2.  Any duplicate items in the resulting list are removed.
~
~
LREMOVE
{lremove:list1,list2}
    Returns the contents of list1, with any items that match an item in
list2 removed.  The resulting list has all duplicate items removed.
~
~
LMEMBER
{lmember:list,item}
{lmember:list,item,delimiter}
    Returns 0 if the given item is NOT in the given list, otherwise, it
returns the item's position in the list.  The first list item in the list
would return 1, and the third would return 3, for example.  If the delimiter
argument is given, then it treats the list as if it were delimited by that
string, instead of by carriage returns. (\r's)
Example:
    {lmember:{mklist:a,b,c,d,e,f},d}
would return 4.
~
~
LSORT
{lsort:list}
{lsort:list,var1,var2,expr}
    Returns the sorted contents of list.  If 4 arguments are given, then
it evaluates expr with a pair of values, in var1 and var2.  If expr
returns true, then it will swap the positions of the two values in the
list.  It runs this comparison on every pair of items in the list, so it
will be evaluated N*(N-1)/2 times, where N is the number of items in the
list.  This method can also be used to randomize a list.  Example:
    {lsort:{&list},v1,v2,{gt:{dice:100},50}}
~
~
COMMAS
{commas:list}
{commas:list,lastsep}
{commas:list,lastsep,var,expr}
    Takes a list and returns a plain english comma delimited string with
the items in it.  For example, {commas:{mklist:Tom,Dick,Harry}} will return
"Tom, Dick and Harry".  If you specify the lastsep argument, you can replace
the "and" with something else, such as "or" to get a result like "a, b or c".
Note:  You need to be careful to include spaces around the "or" or else you
might get a result like "a, borc".  Example:
    {commas:{mklist:a,b,c}, or }
If the var and expr arguments are passed, then for every item in the list,
it will set the value of the given variable name (which it will declare)
to the item, then evaluate expr, and use the result in the string it outputs.
Example:
    {commas:{contents:here},\, or ,v,{name:{&v}}}
will return the name of every object in the room in a comma separated list,
using ", or " as the final conjunction.  ie:  "Tom, Can of SPAM, Dick, or
Harry."

~----------------------------------------------------------------------------
~
~
ISNUM
{isnum:number}
    Returns true if the string passed to it is a valid number.
~
~
ISDBREF
{isdbref:dbref}
    Returns true if the string passed to it is a valid dbref.
~
~
SYSPARM
{sysparm:<system parameter>}
    Returns the value of the given system parameter for authorized players.
~
~
VERSION
{version}
    Returns the version string for the server.
~
~
MUCKNAME
{muckname}
    Returns the muck name string.  For example, it might return: "FurryMUCK"
~
~
MUF
{muf:prog,arg}
    Runs the given MUF prog with the string arg on the stack.  This returns
the top stack value when the prog exits.  If the MPI code was run from a
propqueue like _listen, or _connect, then {muf} cannot run a MUF program
with a mucker level of less than 3 
~
~
DEBUG
{debug:expr}
    This will show MPI debugging information for all the commands within the
given expression.  This is useful for seeing why something isn't working.
This returns the result of the evaluation of expr.

Also see: debugif
~
~
DEBUGIF
{debugif:cond,expr}
    This will evaluate the conditional cond, and, if the result is true,
(not an empty string, and not 0), then this will show MPI debugging info
for all the commands within the given expression.  If cond evaluated as
false, then expr is evaluated without the debugging info being displayed.
This is useful for Debugging code selectively.  This returns the result
of the evaluation of expr.

Example:
    {parse:v,{contents:here},{debugif:{dbeq:{&v},me},{dostuff:{&v}}}}
to only debug the running of the command {dostuff} when the argument will
be the player who is running the MPI.

MACROS
Macros:
    If the MPI interpreter comes across a function name that it does not
recognize, it will look in the _msgmacs/ propdirs down the environment from
the trigger object, for a property with the name of the function.  If it does
find it there, then it takes the value of that property, and substitutes it
in for the function as a macro.  The arguments to the function replace the
{:1} through {:9} markers in the macro definition.  For example, if there were
a property set on #0, defined as:
    _msgmacs/div_rand:{add:{div:{:2},10},{dice:{:1}}}
And you had some MPI code that looked like:
    {div_rand:22,160}
Then the macro would expand out to:
    {add:{div:160,10},{dice:22}}
After the macro argment substitution is complete, it is then evaluated.
~
~
FUNC|FUNCTION
{func:name,vars...,def}
    This effectively defines a function in MPI, with the given name, that
takes the given named variables.  The function is not immediately evaluated,
so it needs to be invoked later, to do anything.  Here's an example:
  
    {func:sqr,val,{mult:{&val},{&val}}}
  
This defines the function 'sqr', that takes a single argument.  That
argument is stored in the 'val' variable.  The function will multiply
the value of the number passed to it, by itself, returning the result.
It's invoked like:
    {sqr:10}
  
Effectively, the above {func} declaration is the same as the following
macro, and in fact, it's internally handled the same way:
  
    _msgmacs/sqr:{with:val,{:1},{mult:{&val},{&val}}}
  
You can define a function that takes more than one argument, but the maximum
number of args you can pass to the function is seven.  Example of multiple
arguments:
  
    {func:names,list,numsp,flagsp,
        {parse:v,{&list},
            {name:{&v}}
            {if:{or:{&numsp},{&flagsp}},
                {lit:(}
                {if:{&numsp},{ref:{&v}}}
                {if:{&flagsp},{flags:{&v}}}
                {lit:)}
            }
        }
    }
    {names:{contents:here},1,1}
